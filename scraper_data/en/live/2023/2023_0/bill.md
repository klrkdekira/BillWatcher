EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia
Act 1999 (“Act 597”).

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of the
proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 597 to expressly provide for
the power of the Human Rights Commission (“Commission”) in carrying out
its functions, to visit, apart from places of detention, any institution and
other place in accordance with the procedures as prescribed by written laws
or specified in the guidelines relating to the institution and place.
This _clause also seeks to provide additional powers to the Commission in_
dealing with human rights matters relating to children, that is, to receive
any communication from children either directly or through any person or
authority relating to the children’s complaints and needs and to act upon
such complaints and needs. This _clause also empowers the Commission to_
establish and adopt mechanisms and procedures in promoting the participation
of children in matters that concern them.

4. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 5 of Act 597 relating to the numbers of
membership of the Commission and criteria of appointment of members of
the Commission. This amendment seeks to provide for the minimum number
of membership of the Commission and to expressly provide that the members
of the Commission shall be appointed from amongst citizens of Malaysia who
have knowledge or practical experience in human rights matters, comprising
men and women of various religious or racial backgrounds, and persons with
disabilities. The members of the Commission appointed shall consist of at
least one representative of person with disabilities and at least thirty per cent
of representatives from amongst women. Any person who is actively involved
in politics and registered with any political party shall not be appointed as a
member of the Commission. This amendment is in line with the aspiration of

the Chairman of the Commission, the Chief Children Commissioner and
the Children Commissioners shall be paid remuneration and allowances as
they are specially designated Commissioners to deal with human rights matters
relating to children and shall work on a full time basis.

7. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 10 of Act 597 relating to the disqualification of
the members of the Commission by substituting for subparagraph 10(d)(ii) of
Act 597 to provide that a member of the Commission may be removed from
his office by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong if the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister, is of the opinion that the member has
breached the code of conduct established under the new section 10a.

8. Clause 7 seeks to introduce new sections 10a and 10b into Act 597. The new
section 10a provides that the Minister may establish a code of conduct which

that the members of the investigation tribunal may be paid such allowances.
The investigation tribunal shall have the power to conduct an investigation

the Commission and shall make its findings and may make any recommendation
based on its findings to the Prime Minister. For the purposes of the investigation,
the investigation tribunal may gather any evidence relating to the alleged
breach of the code of conduct and examine any person that the investigation
tribunal considers necessary, require any person to attend any meeting of the
investigation tribunal to give evidence or produce any document or other thing
in his possession or take any action as may be necessary to obtain further
clarification on matters relating to the investigation. If the investigation tribunal
finds, upon completion of its investigation, that there is a breach of the code
of conduct, the investigation tribunal shall recommend to the Prime Minister
that the member of the Commission be removed from being a member of the
Commission. If the investigation tribunal finds that there is no breach of the
code of conduct, the investigation tribunal shall dismiss the matter and inform
the Prime Minister accordingly. This new section also provides that if an
investigation is instituted in respect of an alleged breach of the code of conduct,
the Yang di-Pertuan Agong may, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister,
suspend such member of the Commission from carrying out his functions.

9. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 11a of Act 597 relating to the
committee consulted by the Prime Minister before tendering his advice to the
Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the appointment of members of the Commission.
_Via this amendment, a new subsection_ 11a(2a) is inserted into Act 597 to
provide that the members of the committee may be paid such allowances as
the Prime Minister may determine.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to insert a new subsection 13(3) into Act 597_

to provide that where the Commission has referred any infringement of human
rights to the relevant authority or person, the relevant authority or person
referred to shall inform the Commission of any action taken in relation to
the infringement of human rights.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to substitute subsection 14(2) of Act 597 relating to_

detained at the place of detention under any written law, or being placed at
any institution or other place to provide that the summon for the purpose
of summoning such person shall be issued in accordance with written laws
or guidelines applicable to such place of detention, institution or place.

12. _Clause 11 seeks to substitute section 22 of Act 597 relating to the_

regulations making power of the Minister under Act 597 consequential to
the insertion of provisions relating to the investigation tribunal. With the
amendment, the Minister may make regulations to provide for matters relating
to the investigation by the investigation tribunal including the procedures for
