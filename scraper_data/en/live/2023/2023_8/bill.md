EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 2002
(“Act 621”). The main purpose of the amendments is to improve the provisions
of Act 621 in providing mutual assistance in criminal matters between Malaysia
and other countries.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act and the power of_
the Minister to appoint the commencement date of the proposed Act.

_Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendment)_ 9

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 2 of Act 621. _Paragraph 2(a) seeks_
to amend subsection 2(1) of Act 621 whereby certain existing definitions in Act 621
are proposed to be amended. _Paragraph 2(a)_ also seeks to introduce a new
definition of “instrumentalities” into Act 621.

The definition of “financial institution” is proposed to be amended to update

and widen the scope of the definition of financial institution to include all
the institutions established under the relevant laws.

The definition of “serious offence” is proposed to be amended to provide

that any offence against the law of Malaysia in respect of which the punishment
provided by the law is imprisonment for a period of at least one year, or a more
severe punishment and any attempt, abetment or conspiracy to commit any
of such offences is a serious offence.

The definition of “foreign serious offence” is proposed to be amended

to provide that any offence against the law of a prescribed foreign State in respect of
which the punishment provided by the law is imprisonment for a period of
at least one year, or a more severe punishment is a foreign serious offence.

The definition of “authorized officer” is proposed to be amended to update

the reference to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission.

The definition of “instrumentalities” is introduced into Act 621 to widen

the scope of the Act 621 to include instrumentalities which is used in,
or in connection with, the commission of any serious offence or foreign
serious offence.

The definition of “forfeiture order” is proposed to be amended to provide

that a forfeiture order means an order made in Malaysia for the forfeiture
of property and instrumentalities. Currently, a forfeiture order only covers
an order for the forfeiture of property.

The definition of “foreign forfeiture order” is proposed to be amended

to include instrumentalities or value of such instrumentalities in an order for
the recovery, forfeiture or confiscation issued by a court in a prescribed
foreign State. The definition of “foreign forfeiture order” is also proposed
to be amended to overcome the impractical requirement that
a foreign forfeiture order must only be issued by a requesting foreign State
after a special direction for the foreign State has been issued under section 18
of Act 621. Under normal circumstances, a foreign forfeiture order would
have already been issued by a foreign judicial authority and the order sent to
Malaysia for execution through mutual assistance in criminal matters before
a special direction in respect of the foreign State is issued.

The definition of “ancillary criminal matter” is proposed to be amended

to include instrumentalities in restraining of dealing with, or the seizure,
forfeiture or confiscation, in connection with a serious offence or
a foreign serious offence. Under the existing provision, an ancillary criminal matter
only covers a restraining of dealing with, or the seizure, forfeiture or
confiscation of, property.

the international assistance in criminal matters only covers the recovery, forfeiture
or confiscation of property.

the Attorney General under certain circumstances to make a request for

shall be accompanied by the location and description of the instrumentalities.

foreign State stating that other instrumentalities recoverable under a foreign
forfeiture order remain unrecovered in that prescribed foreign State shall be
received in evidence without further proof.

12. _Clause 11 seeks to amend subparagraph 36(2)(b)(i) of Act 621 to provide that_

an application for a search warrant may be made if the application fulfills
the conditions that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the thing

of which the application is made. Under the existing provision, a stringent
condition is imposed whereby it must be shown that the thing to which the
application relates is likely to be of substantial value to the criminal matter.
