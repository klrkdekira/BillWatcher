a Multinational Top-up Tax of the Low-Taxed Constituent
Entity in accordance with subsection (2).


-----

_Finance (No. 2)_ 69

is reliable; and

_(c) permanent differences in excess of one million euro that_

arise from the application of a particular principle or

of deductible expenses in that jurisdiction; or

paragraph 157(1)(c) of the definition of “Permanent
Establishment”, to reflect only the amounts and

Establishment is treated as an expense in the computation
of the domestic taxable income of such Main Entity and is
not set off against an item of income that is subject to tax
under the laws of both the jurisdiction of the Main Entity
and the jurisdiction of the Permanent Establishment.

(7) GloBE Income subsequently arising in the Permanent

(3) A deferred tax asset that has been recorded at a rate lower
than the Minimum Rate may be recast at the Minimum Rate
in the Financial Year such deferred tax asset becomes a GloBE

asset is attributable to a GloBE Loss and the Total Deferred
Tax Adjustment Amount in subsection (2) is reduced by the
amount that a deferred tax asset is increased due to being
recast under this subsection.
