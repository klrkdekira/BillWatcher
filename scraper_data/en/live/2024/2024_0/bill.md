4 _Bill_

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill (“the proposed Act”) seeks to repeal the Declaration of an Area
in the Bintulu District to be a Federal Port Act 1979 [Act 217].

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and seeks to empower the Minister_
to appoint the date of coming into operation of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to provide for the repeal of the Declaration of an Area in_
the Bintulu District to be a Federal Port Act 1979 and any orders made under
this Act, on the date of coming into operation of the proposed Act, shall cease
to have effect due to the change in the policy of the Government to change
the status of the Bintulu Port from a federal port to a state port. As such, the
Declaration of an Area in the Bintulu District to be a Federal Port Act 1979
is no longer applicable.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN(U2)3359]
