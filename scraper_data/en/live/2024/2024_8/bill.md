Malaysia’s standing amongst the global international arbitration community
by improving the organizational structure of the Asian International Arbitration
Centre in line with the execution of the Supplementary Agreement between the
Government of Malaysia and the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization

Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on International
Commercial Arbitration (“UNCITRAL Model Law”) and by introducing the
provisions on third party funding.

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and the provision on the commencement
of the proposed Act.

contents of an award to provide that the signatures of the arbitrator on an
award shall include the digital and electronic signatures of the arbitrators on
the award. “Digital signature” shall have the meaning assigned to it in the
Digital Signature Act 1997 [Act 562] whilst “electronic signature” shall have
the meaning assigned to it in the Electronic Commerce Act 2006 [Act 658].

the provision with the UNCITRAL Model Law. With this amendment, the
award made in respect of the arbitration shall be recognized as binding at the
first instance without requiring an application to be made to the High Court
for its recognition.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend Part III of Act 646 on additional provisions_

relating to arbitration by dividing Part III into two Chapters to accommodate
the introduction of provisions of third party funding of arbitration into
Act 646.

_Subclause 10(a) seeks to amend Part III by inserting after the heading of_

Part III the heading for the new Chapter 1.

_Arbitration (Amendment)_ 13

_Subclause 10(b) seeks to amend paragraph 41a(2)(c) in the national language_

text of Act 646 to make it clear that the term “professional” used in the paragraph
refers to any professional and not only confined to professional advisers. This
amendment is also in line with the English language text of paragraph 41a(2)(c)
of Act 646.

_Subclause 10(c) seeks to insert the new Chapter 2 into Part III of Act 646_

which consists of sections 46a to 46i.

The new section 46a seeks to provide for the definitions of certain terms used

in Chapter 2 of Part III of Act 646 namely “costs or expenses of arbitration”,
“third party funder”, “third party funding”, “third party funding agreement”
and “funded party”.

The new section 46b seeks to provide that Chapter 2 of Part III of Act 646

shall not apply to any third party funding agreement made before the date of
the commencement of this Chapter.

The new section 46c seeks to provide that the rule of common law against

maintenance and champerty shall cease to apply in relation to the third party
funding of arbitration and that a third party funding agreement shall not be
treated as contrary to public policy on the grounds of maintenance and champerty.
With this provision, third party funding of arbitration and court proceedings
in respect of an arbitration shall no longer be prohibited in Malaysia.

The new section 46d seeks to provide for the power of the Minister to

issue a code of practice setting out the practices and standards relating to
third party funding in which third party funders are ordinarily expected to
comply. This section also provides that the code of practice shall be published
in the manner as the Minister may determine and the Minister may revoke,
vary, revise or amend the whole or in part any code of practice issued under
this section.

The new section 46e seeks to provide for the effect of non-compliance and

compliance with code of practice issued under section 46d.

The new section 46f seeks to provide for the disclosure of information

by a party for the purpose of seeking or securing a third party funding from
a person.

The new section 46g seeks to provide for the disclosure on third party

funding agreement by the funded party to the other party to the arbitration,
the arbitral tribunal and court.

The new section 46h seeks to provide for the disclosure of termination or

end of third party funding agreement by the funded party to the other party
to the arbitration, the arbitral tribunal and court.

The new section 46i seeks to provide for the effect of non-compliance

and compliance with any of the provisions under the new sections 46f, 46g
and 46h.


-----

14 _Bill_

12. _Clause 11 seeks to amend section 48 of Act 646 on the immunity of_

the arbitral institutions by deleting the reference to the Director of the Asian
International Arbitration Centre (Malaysia) in that section. With this amendment,
this section will provide in general that any person or institution acting in
the capacity of an appointing authority authorized by the parties shall not be
liable for anything done or omitted in the discharge of the function unless
the act or omission is shown to have been in bad faith.

13. _Clause 12_ deals with saving provision.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
