8. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 10 by substituting the Registrar
with the Commission. This amendment, also found in other sections
is to effect a rationalised structure for the Commission to be the
single supervisory authority over the central depository,

9. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 13 to enable the central depository
to prescribe in its rules the purposes of the appointment of authorised
depository agents. The clause also substitutes for the Registrar the
Commission.

10. Clause 9 seeks to amend section 14 to provide for the power
of the Commission to exempt the stock exchange from having to
publish prescription notices in three daily national newspapers in
appropriate circumstances. This is to reduce the costs of prescribing
securities into the central depository system where further notification
is superfluous and wasteful. For example, in the case of new listing
of securities which are prescribed into the central depository, the
listing rules of the stock exchange and the Commission's Guidelines
For The New Issue Of Securities And The Valuation Of Public
Limited Companies would have required the issuer to publish the
fact of the prescription in its prospectus and in the newspapers.
In such an event, the shareholders of the issuer would also be notified
at the company's general meeting convened for the purposes of
listing of the securities of the company on the stock exchange.
Therefore to require further notification by the stock exchange would
only increase the cost of prescribing the securities into the central
depository system.

11. Clause 10 seeks to amend section 15. This is consequential to
the amendment of section 14.

12. Clause 11 seeks to amend section 17 to enable a prescribed
security that is deposited with the central depository to be capable
of being utilised to settle a transaction on the stock market of a stock
exchange if the issuer of the security registers the transfer of the
security in favour of the central depository and delivers the appropriate
certificate to the central depository.

13. Clause 12 seeks to amend section 23, consequential to the
amendment of section 17.

14. Clause 13 seeks to amend section 24 to substitute for the
Minister the Commission.

15. Clause 14 seeks to amend section 26 to place the duty to issue
statements which is an operational matter, within the ambit of the
rules of the central depository.

16. Clause 15 seeks to amend section 28 by substituting for the
Registrar the Commission.
