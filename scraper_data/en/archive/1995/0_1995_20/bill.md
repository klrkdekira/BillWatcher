EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Securities Commission Act 1993 ("the
Act").

2. _Clause 1 provides for the short title and the coming into force_
of this Bill.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to insert or amend the various definitions as_
follows:

_(a) the definition of "associate", taken from the Securities_
Industry Act 1983 is introduced into this Act. This term
is used in the amended Part IV of the Act particularly in
sections 32, 32B, 33, 33A and 33E;

_(b) the definition of "clearing house" is amended by substituting_
for "settlement of trading in futures contracts" the words
"clearing house approved under subsection 6B(1) of the
Futures Industry Act 1993" consequential to the amendment
of the Futures Industry Act 1993;

_(c) the definition of "exchange" is substituted to streamline_
the term used in the Act consequential to the amendment
of the Futures Industry Act 1993 which has deleted all
references to a "futures exchange" and has substituted
therefor the term "exchange company";

_(d) the definition of "exchange company" is inserted_
consequential to the amendment of the Futures Industry
Act 1993 which has replaced all references to "futures
exchange" with "exchange company";

_(e) the definition of "futures contract" is substituted with a_
new definition consequential to the amendment of that
term under the Futures Industry Act 1993;

_(f) the definition of "futures exchange" is deleted consequential_
to the amendment of the Futures Industry Act 1993 which
has replaced the term "futures exchange" with the term
"exchange company";

_(g) the definition of "futures market" is substituted_
consequential to the amendment of the Futures Industry
Act 1993;


-----

38 BILL

_(h) the definition of "futures options transactions" is deleted_
consequential to the amendment of the Futures Industry
Act 1993;

_(i) new definitions of "licence" and "licensed persons" are_
inserted for ease of reference to the terms when used in
the Act. The insertion of the latter definition is consequential
to the deletion of the definition of "registered persons"
in order to reflect more accurately the licensing scheme
of intermediaries both under the Securities Industry Act
1983 and the Futures Industry Act 1993;

_(j) new definitions of "prescribed" and "record" are inserted_
to clarify the meaning of the terms when used in the Act;

_(k) the definition of "registered persons" is deleted as the_
reference to the term as regards persons who are licensed
under the Securities Industry Act 1983 and the Futures
Industry Act 1993 is now changed to "licensed persons"
to reflect more accurately the licensing regime under these
laws;

_(l) new definitions of "securities laws" and "specify" are_
inserted to clarify their meanings when used in the Act;
and

_(m) the definition of "trading in futures contracts" is substituted_
with a new definition of "trade" consequential to the
amendment of the Futures Industry Act 1993.

4. _Clause 3 inserts a new section 2A into the Act to clarify that_
the terms "this Act" and "securities laws" when used in the Act
include regulations, orders, notifications or other subsidiary legislation
made under the principal Act or securities laws.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 13 of the Act to clarify that_
a member of the Commission or the Committee must disclose any.
indirect or direct interest in any matter. The existing provision has
given rise to difficulties in gathering sufficient quorum for the
Commission's or the committee's meetings, thereby impeding the
efficient conduct of meetings. The proposed amendments also seek
to remove the obstacles posed by subsections 13(2} and (3) which
on many occasions have the unintended effect of disqualifying
members of the Commission or committee from deliberating or
voting on matters which are unrelated to his disclosed interest. The
proposed amendment disqualifies a member of the Commission or
committee from continuing to deliberate or decide on the matter in
which he has an interest in.

SECURITIES COMMISSION (AMENDMENT) 39

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 15 of the Act to clarify the_
intended meaning of the various paragraphs contained therein as
regards the functions of the Commission.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 16 of the Act to clarify that_
the Commission shall have all the powers to perform any of its
functions under securities laws.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 19 of the Act to enable the_
Minister to give to the Commission directions of a general character
which are not inconsistent with the functions of the Commission
under the principal Act. The Minister may also require the Commission
to furnish him with such information as he may require with respect
to the Commission's functions under the securities laws.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 22 of the Act to expand the_
Commission's power to grant loans and make advances to include
the power to provide scholarships and study loans to its officers,
servants and other persons such as the dependants of officers and
servants.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to insert a new section 22A to the Act to_
enable the Commission to participate in any body corporate, with
the approval of the Minister, for the purpose of promoting research
and training in relation to the securities and futures industries. This
is particularly necessary in view of the need to upgrade professional
standards and inculcate a market culture that is conducive to capital
market development in Malaysia.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 24 of the Act. The amendments_
to subsection (2) and subsection (6) are consequential to the
amendments that are made to the Futures Industry Act 1993.

12. _Clause 11 seeks to amend the whole of Part IV of the Act._
The proposed amendments seek to abolish the concept of "public
offer", clarify the types of transactions that would come within the
ambit of the Commission and to enable the Commission, through
regulations, to provide for the criteria that would facilitate corporate
issue transactions to take place in an efficient, competitive and
informed market.

The proposed subsection 32(2) has done away with the traditional
concept of subjecting issues of securities made to the public or a
section of the public to regulatory oversight. Paragraphs (a) to (g)
spell out the types of proposals that are required to be submitted
to the Commission for its approval.


-----

40 BILL

The new subsections 32(7) and (8) enable the Commission to take
certain actions in the event of any contravention of subsection 32c(l),
or any breach of the terms and conditions imposed pursuant to an
approval granted or if there should be any change or development
in the circumstances relating to the proposal subsequent to the
Commission giving its approval. The new subsection 32(8) disallows
the Commission from taking any action under subsection (7) unless
it has given the applicant a reasonable opportunity to be heard.

In order to ensure investors' protection, the new subsection 32(9)
seeks to prevent misrepresentation by issuers as regards the
Commission's approval given to any proposal by requiring a statement
to be made to the effect that the fact of the Commission's approval
shall not be taken to indicate that the Commission recommends the
proposal to investors.

The new subsection 32(10) allows conditional agreements to be
entered into without them being unwittingly brought within the
prohibition in subsection (4).

The new subsection 32(11) reinstates the requirements in the existing
subsection 32(4) of the principal Act.

The new section 32A is introduced because the comprehensive coverage
of section 32(2) necessitates that certain classes or categories of
securities or transactions are not brought under the purview of
subsection 32(4). These classes or categories are specified in the
Schedule. There are also other classes or certain categories of securities
or transactions which the Minister may prescribe so as not to subject
such securities or transactions to the purview of subsection 32(4).
This is to ensure that various commercial transactions may take
place efficiently without regulatory intervention where the application
of the section is unintended.

The new section 32B creates an offence of supplying false or
misleading statements to the Commission in relation to any proposal.
It imposes on an issuer and its officers, a financial adviser or any
other person whose expertise is normally relied upon, a continuing
duty to be diligent in making statements or giving information to
the Commission.

Section 33 is amended to firmly establish the basis of regulation
of take-overs and mergers. The proposed amendments to section 33
seek to provide for a regulatory framework within which the Code
may operate effectively and without legal impediments.

The new subsection (1) introduces various crucial definitions to the
operation of this Division and the Code whilst a few definitions are
taken from the existing section 33. The term "control" is defined
to mean the acquisition or holding of, or entitlement to exercisevoting shares in a company of more than thirty-three per centum.


-----

SECURITIES COMMISSION (AMENDMENT) 41

The new definition of "persons acting in concert" in subsection (2)
is to ensure that the Code on Take-Overs and Mergers apply not
only to a person or persons who acquire or propose to acquire
control in a company but also persons acting in concert with the
person or persons.

The new section 33A empowers the Minister to prescribe the Code
and publish the Code in the Gazette. The Commission is empowered
to issue rulings interpreting the Code to assist the implementation
of the Code and clarify the meanings of the different provisions of
the proposed Code.

The new section 33B imposes statutory obligations on acquirers
under various circumstances to comply with provisions of Division
2 and the Code. Failure of compliance will render such persons
guilty of an offence.

The new section 33c is inserted to enable waivers to be granted
only if various criteria spelled out in subsection 33A(5) applies.
This is to enable the Commission to grant waivers to particular
take-overs if their regulation is unintended.

The new section 33D is inserted to outline the various actions that
can be taken by the Commission to enforce the Code and any rulings
made thereunder. These actions may be in the form of a direction
against the defaulting person, the imposition of a civil penalty, a
reprimand whether of a public or private nature or to direct the
stock exchange to deprive the defaulting person access to the facilities
of a stock exchange. Some of the actions that can be taken by the
Commission under this section are found in the existing provisions
of subsection 33(10) of the Act.

The new section 33E creates an offence of supplying false or
misleading document and information to the Commission in relation
to or in connection with a take-over offer, merger or compulsory
acquisition. This new section imposes on acquirers and their associates,
offerees and professionals such as a financial adviser or any other
person whose expertise is normally relied upon, a continuing duty
to be diligent in providing documents or information.

The new section 34 seeks to streamline and clarify the procedures
involved in relation to compulsory acquisitions. The new section
34 applies to take-over offers to acquire all the shares of a target
company, or all the shares of a particular class, not already held
by the offerer. The offerer's right to compulsorily acquire shares
of non-accepting shareholders is triggered when he receives
acceptances relating to ninety per centum in nominal value of the
shares to which the offer relates provided that he receives them
within four months.


-----

42 BILL

The new section 34A outlines the rights of minority shareholders
to compel acquisition by the offerer so as to be bought out of the
target company on the terms of the take-over offer. Relief may be
sought by the minority shareholders by way of application to the
Court under section 34B.

The new section 34B outlines the right of a dissenting shareholder
to make an application to Court to compel the offerer in a successful
take-over offer to buy him out from the target company on the
terms of the take-over offer. At the same time, an offerer who has
obtained ninety per centum of the nominee value of the shares to
which the offer relates may make an application to Court and the
Court may order the terms on which the offerer is entitled to and
bound to acquire the shares as the Court may deem fit.

The new section 34c is introduced to avoid dual regulation of
compulsory acquisitions; as section 180 of the Companies Act 1965
does not apply in respect of a take-over offer to which subsection
34(1) of the Act applies.

13. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 36 of the Act to clarify the_
powers of the Investigating Officers of the Commission to enter
premises and make inspection where an offence under securities
laws is suspected of being committed.

14. Clause 13 seeks to insert new sections 39A and 39B. The new
section 39A provides for a general penalty with punishment of a
fine not exceeding one million ringgit or an imprisonment term not
exceeding five years if a person is found guilty of an offence under
this Act for which no express penalty has been provided for. Section
39B is inserted to provide that where a body corporate is found
guilty of an offence under the Act, its director, an executive, an
employee or the secretary of the body corporate is deemed to have
committed an offence unless such person proves that the commission
of the offence was done without his consent or connivance and he
had exercised all such diligence to prevent the commission of the
offence having regard to the nature of his functions in that capacity
and to all circumstances.

15. _Clause 14 seeks to amend section 41 to streamline the provisions_
whereby the Commission may engage suitable persons to assist it
in the discharge of its duties or performance of its functions.

16. _Clause 15 seeks to introduce a new section 42A to provide_
that the Commission's decision made under the Act is final.

17. Clause 16 inserts new sections 43A, 43B and 43c. Section 43A
provides that the Commission may either at its own initative or
upon the request of a public officer supply to a police or other
public officer, books or documents seized, detained or taken possession


-----

SECURITIES COMMISSION (AMENDMENT) 43

of or records of examination made or written statement. The police
or other public officer to whom the same is supplied may make use
of the same as may be necessary or expedient in relation to his
powers, performance of his functions or discharge of his duties in
respect of any person.

Section 43B seeks to empower the Commission to provide assistance
to foreign supervisory authorities as the Commission thinks fit.
This is to facilitate international co-operation in the area of
enforcement.

Section 43c empowers the Commission to specify the manner and
form in which information may be required from a person and the
period for complying with the request.

18. _Clause / 7 seeks to amend section 44 of the Act by substituting_
new paragraphs (c) and (d) consequential to the amendments to
Part IV of the Act.

19. _Clause 18 seeks to insert a new section 44A which confers_
an indemnity on the Commission, a member of the Commission or
committee, the Chairman or any officer of the Commission who
has acted in good faith in the performance of their duties under the
securities laws. This is necessary to ensure that the discharge of
regulatory functions or the performance of duties by these persons
may be carried on efficaciously and are not fraught with legal
liabilities.

20. _Clause 19 seeks to insert a Schedule into the Act in respect_
of classes or categories of securities or transactions not subject to
subsection 32(4).

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure
the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN. (U[2]) 1824.]
