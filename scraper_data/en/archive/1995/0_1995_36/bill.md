EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the National Land Code ("the Code").

2. Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title and commencement
of this Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to make a consequential amendment to paragraph
14(1)(g) of the Code necessitated by the amendment made to
subsection 433B(2) and the introduction of the new section 433E
which provide for the imposition of a levy to be prescribed.

4. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 301A of the Code to specify
that, where applicable, any instrument which has been presented
and entered in the Presentation Book, shall not be registered if the
levy payable under subsection 433B(2) has not been paid at the time
of presentation.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new section 428AA to provide for_
offences committed by a body corporate or its directors or officers.
Where the body corporate is convicted of the offence every director
or officer shall be deemed to be guilty unless he proves that he had
no knowledge of the matter or had taken reasonable steps to prevent
the commission of the offence.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend the definition of "foreign company"_
in section 433A of the Code to widen its scope in order to cover
foreign companies incorporated outside Malaysia, local companies
which are controlled by non-citizens or foreign companies, and
local companies which are controlled by other local foreign-controlled
companies to the extent of thirty per cent or more of their voting
shares. Such "foreign companies" shall be subject to the restrictions
contained in Part Thirty-Three (A).

8 BILL

7. Clause 6 seeks to amend paragraph 433 B(l)(a) by deleting the
words "or an interest in land" which are considered inappropriate
or unnecessary. It also seeks to amend the proviso to subsection
433B(l) for further clarity. These amendments shall be deemed to
have come into force from 1 January 1993, that is, the date of
commencement of Part Thirty-Three (A).

An additional proviso is also introduced to provide that the approval
of the State Authority shall not be required in respect of any dealing
effected pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement for which approval
has been granted under the new section 433E .

Subsection 433(B)(2) has been amended to provide for the
imposition of a levy to be prescribed in the rules.

8. Clause 7 seeks to amend the Code by re-numbering the existing
section 433E as section 433H. It also seeks to introduce three new
sections, namely, sections 433E, 433F and 433G.

The proposed section 433E seeks to provide that any acquisition
by a non-citizen or a foreign company of any alienated land or any
interest therein by way of a conveyance or disposal in a manner
other than those specified in subsection 433B(1), that is, by means
which do not require registration under the Code, is also subject to
the restrictions provided therein and to the payment of such levy as
may be prescribed. The restrictions, however, do not apply to industrial
land. Any person or body conveying or disposing of, or any noncitizen or foreign company accepting the conveyance or disposal
of, any alienated land or any interest therein without the prior approval
of the State Authority shall be guilty of an offence and shall, if
convicted, be liable to a fine of not less than one hundred thousand
ringgit.

The proposed section 433F seeks to render void the execution of
any deed or instrument under a power of attorney in respect of any
alienated land or any interest therein by a non-citizen or a foreign
company in favour of any person or body. It will, however, not
render invalid any instrument or deed effected before the
commencement of the section and which has been stamped either
before or within one month after such commencement.

The proposed section 433G seeks to provide that any levy
specified under Part Thirty-Three (A) shall be paid not later than
thirty days from the date of the service of the notice of approval
given by the State Authority. If the levy is not paid within the time
specified, the approval shall thereupon lapse.


-----

NATIONAL LAND CODE (AMENDMENT) 9

9. Clause 8 seeks to provide for the validation of all levies collected
and all acts done after 27 October 1995 until the commencement of
this Act.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1913.]
