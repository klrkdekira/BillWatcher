certain definitions and to introduce certain new definitions for

Act, all the assets of a dealer, including those unconnected
with the business of dealing in securities, to be his assets;

_(b) the definition of "central depository" to enable ease of_
reference to the central depository established under the
Securities Industry (Central Depositories) Act 1991;

providing services for clearing and settlement of securities
transactions;

_(d) the definition of "dealer's representative" to clarify the_
meaning of the term;

_(e) the definition of "dealing in securities" to clarify the_
meaning of the term and as a consequence of the amendment
to the Futures Industry Act 1993;

_(f) the definition of "exempt dealer" consequential to the_
introduction of a fund manager's licence under section

_(g) the definition of "exempt fund manager" to refer to persons_
exempted by the Minister under paragraph 15A(2)(d);

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend paragraph 3(l)(d) of the Act to include
sole-proprietors and partnerships as associates for the purposes of
the Act.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend subsection 4(5) of the Act to clarify_
that the interest referred to in the subsection refers to an interest
in a security.

6. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 7 of the Act to empower the_
Minister to exempt any stock market from the requirement to comply
with subsection 7(1). In granting such exemption, the Minister may
impose any conditions or restrictions as he thinks reasonable and
appropriate. This is to ensure that the Act does not extend to a
market where it is neither practicable nor necessary for the protection
of investors to require prior authorisation.

7. Clause 8 seeks to introduce new sections 8 A and 8B. Section
8 A brings clearing houses under the Commission's regulatory oversight
by empowering the Commission to make a declaration recognising
a clearing house. Section 8 B allows the Commission to withdraw
the recognition of a clearing house subject to the procedures specified
in the section.

8. Clause 9 seeks to amend section 9 of the Act to require the
stock exchange to submit to the Commission any proposal for
amendment of its rules. In addition, the Commission is empowered
to exempt any class of rules from this requirement to enable the
stock exchange to introduce certain classes of rules without having
to submit an application to the Commission.

9. Clause 10 seeks to introduce new sections 9A, 9B and 9C.
Section 9A requires a recognised clearing house to submit to the
Commission any proposal for amendment of its rules. In addition,
the Commission is empowered to exempt any class of rules from
this requirement to enable the recognised clearing house to introduce
certain classes of rules without having to submit an application to
the Commission.

Section 9B is introduced to specify the statutory duty of the
stock exchange to ensure an orderly and fair market in the securities
traded through its facilities. This section also emphasises the duty
of the stock exchange to act in the public interest and to ensure
that members, member companies and listed corporations comply
with its rules.


-----

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) 103

Section 9C is introduced to enable the Minister to close a stock
market of the stock exchange where orderly trading on the stock
exchange is or is likely to be prevented by emergencies or natural
disasters or by economic or financial crisis whether in Malaysia or
elsewhere.

10. Clause 11 seeks to substitute sections 10 and 11 of the Act.
The proposed amendment to section 10 and other similar amendments
throughout the Act seeks to rationalise the regulatory structure over
the securities industry and to clearly outline the functions, powers
and obligations of the Commission in relation thereto. The proposed
amendment to section 11 seeks to empower the stock exchange and
recognised clearing house to enforce the rules of the stock exchange
or recognised clearing house.

11. Clause 12 seeks to introduce new sections 11 A and 11B. Section
11 A empowers the Commission to prohibit trading in particular
securities or classes of securities under specified circumstances.

Section 11B empowers the Minister to issue suspension orders
against a stock exchange, recognised clearing house or central
depository under specified circumstances.

12. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 13 of the Act to prohibit_
a person from acting as a dealer's representative unless he holds
a dealer's representative's licence and unless he is in the employ
of a dealer holding a dealer's licence.

13. Clause 14 seeks to substitute sections 15 and 15A. Section 15
seeks to prohibit a person from acting as an investment representative
unless he holds an investment representative's licence and unless
he is in the employ of an investment adviser holding an investment
adviser's licence.

Section 15A seeks to introduce a new class of licence for fund
managers. Formerly, fund managers were licensed as dealers under
the Act. Given the important role fund managers play in the capital
market, a more appropriate regulatory framework over fund managers
is desirable.

14. _Clause 15 seeks to introduce new sections 15B and 15C. Section_
15B seeks to prohibit a person from acting as a fund manager's
representative unless he holds a fund manager's representative's
licence and unless he is in the employ of a fund manager holding
a fund manager's licence.

Section 15B makes contravention of section 12, 13, 14, 15 A or
15B an offence.


-----

104 BILL

15. _Clause 16 seeks to amend section 16 of the Act to require_
all applications for licences to be submitted to the Commission.
The amendment in this section as well as other similar amendments
throughout the Act are consequential to the transfer of the licensing
powers to the Commission. This is to rationalise the regulatory
structure of the securities industry.

16. _Clause 17 seeks to amend section 17 of the Act to specify_
the grounds on which an application for a licence may be refused
by the Commission. Subsection 17(2) provides that the Commission
shall not refuse any application for a licence without giving the
person an opportunity to be heard.

17. _Clause 18 seeks to introduce a new section 17A to require_
a licenced person to notify the Commission immediately after the
happening of any event which is a ground on which the Commission
may revoke a licence under section 27 of the Act.

18. _Clause 19 seeks to substitute sections 18 and 19 of the Act._

with the concurrence of the Minister and to itself approve a fund
manager's licence, an investment adviser's licence, a dealer's
representative's licence, a fund manager's representative's licence
and an investment representative's licence. The Commission may
also impose conditions or restrictions on a licence when granting
or renewing the licence. The amendment to section 19 is consequential
in nature.

19. _Clause 21 seeks to introduce a new section 20A to empower_
the Commission to prescribe minimum financial requirements.

in lieu of revocation.

23. _Clause 27 seeks to introduce a new section 28A to allow a_
licenced person to surrender his licence and requires the licensed
person to meet all obligations as well as liabilities outstanding at

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) 105

24. _Clause 29 seeks to amend section 30 of the Act to provide_
for the procedure for notification where a person is required to
keep a register under the Act. Subsection 30(3) seeks to lessen the
burden of a person to whom this Part applies in that it proposes
that the duty to keep a record only arises from the time such person
becomes aware of the acquisition.

25. _Clause 31 seeks to amend section 32 of the Act to clarify that_
the defence provided under that section only applies to a failure to
comply with either section 30 or 31 of the Act.

26. _Clause 33 seeks to amend section 38 of the Act to empower_
the Minister to make regulations with respect to the giving of contract
notes by dealers and fund managers who carry on the business of
managing a portfolio of securities. This is to facilitate flexibility
as well as to enable the Minister to prescribe appropriate regulations
on the conduct of business by dealers and fund managers in step
with market developments.

27. _Clause 34 seeks to amend section 39 of the Act to extend the_
duty to disclose certain interests in securities to fund managers and

advisers and their representatives to have a reasonable basis.

Section 40B requires dealers, fund managers and investment advisers
to furnish to the Commission such returns or other information as
the Commission may require.

Section 40C allows the Commission to prescribe or impose on
licensed persons such further requirements with respect to the conduct
of the financial affairs of such licensed persons.

facilitate regulated shortselling on the stock exchange.

requirements of dealers.

the types of accounting records and other records that a dealer is

-----

106 BILL

33. _Clause 41 seeks to amend section 44 of the Act to require_
monies received by dealers to be paid into a trust account not later
than the next bank business day.

the manner in which a dealer is to deal with property, other than

the circumtances when a dealer is allowed to utilise the monies of
the trust account.

36. _Clause 44 seeks to introduce a new section 45A to impose_
on a dealer an obligation to supply, on demand, to its client or any
person authorised by the client, copies of all entries relating to any
transaction carried out on behalf of the client.

37. _Clause 46 seek to amend Part VII of the Act to create a new_
Division 2 (sections 47A to 47E) to deal specifically with the accounting
requirements of fund managers.

Section 47A clarifies the application of this Division to a fund
manager.

Section 47B places an obligation on a fund manager with respect
to the accounts of its business.

this Division in relation to the operation of the trust account.

Section 47D prohibits a fund manager from using client monies
to deal in securities except in the situations specified in the section.

on demand, to his client or any person authorised by the client,

relevant persons under Division 3 of Part VII of the Act to appoint
an auditor and specifies the situations in which an auditor may be

where the Commission is not satisfied with the way the auditor is
performing his duties.


-----

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) 107

40. _Clause 49 seeks to introduce a new section 48A to prohibit_
the appointment of the associates of relevant persons as auditors.

41. Clause 50 seeks to amend sections 49 and 50 of the Act. The
amendment to section 50 seeks to widen the obligations of an auditor
in the performance of his duties under the Act.

42. _Clause 51 seeks to amend section 51 of the Act to impose_
an obligation on a relevant person or its directors or officers, to
furnish an auditor appointed under Division 3 of Part VII of the
Act with information of the type specified therein and to ensure
that such information is not false or misleading in any material
particular.

43. _Clauses 58 to 69 seek to amend Part VIII of the Act to replace_
the existing fidelity fund with a compensation fund in the light of
the defects inherent in the structure and operations of the fidelity
fund. Further, the "fidelity fund" does not adequately represent the
role and function of the fund as a means of compensating investors
as a result of defaults of member companies. In addition, there is
in existence a cumbersome procedure for making claims and this
gives rise to much delay, additional costs and undue formality in
respect of claims made against the fund. The provisions relating to
the "compensation fund" which is sought to be introduced here
seek to restructure the existing fidelity fund to be a more broad
based compensation fund.

44. _Clause 59 seeks to substitute sections 60, 61, 62, 63 and 64_
of the Act. The amendment to sections 61 and 62 seek to provide
for the establishment of the compensation fund and to prescribe the
monies constituting the compensation fund. The amendment to section
63 seeks to provide that the monies forming part of the compensation
fund are to be kept in a" separate trust account whilst the amendment
to section 64 seeks to prescribe the purposes for which and the
order in which payment out of the compensation fund may be made.

45. _Clause 60 seeks to amend section 65 of the Act to require_
the stock exchange to keep proper accounts in relation to the
compensation fund.

46. Clause 61 seeks to substitute sections 66, 67, 68 and 69 of
the Act. The amendment to section 66 seeks to enable the Commission,
after consultation with the relevant stock exchange, to require the
relevant stock exchange to pay a portion of its net income into the
compensation fund whilst the amendment to section 67 places a
direct obligation on member companies to make annual contributions
to the compensation fund. The amendment to section 68 allows a
member company who has made the prescribed number of annual
contributions to be freed and discharged from further annual


-----

108 BILL

contributions where the amount at credit in the compensation fund
exceeds fifty million ringgit. However, where the amount at credit
is less than ten million ringgit, such member company may again
be required to contribute to the compensation fund. The amendment
to section 69 enables the Minister to impose a levy, the amount of
which is to be determined by the Minister, on member companies
when the compensation fund is unable to satisfy its liabilities.

47. _Clause 63 seeks to substitute sections 71 and 72 of the Act._
Section 71 is amended to empower the stock exchange to invest
monies belonging to the compensation fund. Section 72 is amended
to overcome the problems associated with the use of the term
"defalcation" which is required to be proved before a claim can be
made against the compensation fund. The purpose of this amendment
is to broaden the scope of the claims which can be made against
the compensation fund and to ensure that investors can be adequately
protected even in cases of fradulent misuse of property and in the
event of insolvency of member companies.

48. _Clause 66 seeks to substitute sections 79 and 80 of the Act._
The amendment to section 79 seeks to clarify the right of the stock
exchange to subrogation once payment has been made out of the
compensation fund. The limits of the claimant's right are also laid
down. Section 80 is amended to provide that only the monies and
property of the compensation fund may be used to satisfy a claim
against the compensation fund.

49. _Clause 68 seeks to substitute sections 82 and 83 of the Act._
The amendment to section 82 seeks to clarify the powers of the
relevant stock exchange to enter into contracts of insurance whilst
the amendment to section 83 seeks to provide that a claimant shall
not have any right against the insurer or any monies paid by an
insurer under a contract of insurance.

50. Clause 69 seeks to introduce new sections 83 A and 83B. Section
83A deals with the affairs of the compensation fund when the stock
exchange is wound up. Section 83B empowers the Minister to make
regulations in respect of the compensation fund.

51. _Clause 70 seeks to amend section 94A of the Act by inserting_
the words "the Commission or" before the words "the Registrar".
The amendment here and elsewhere in the Act is to reflect the dual
regulatory authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act.

52. _Clause 72 seeks to introduce a new section 95A to confer on_
the Commission and the Registrar the power to require a person
to submit information in such form and manner as may be requested
by the Commission or Registrar.


-----

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) 109

53. _Clause 77 seeks to amend section 120 of the Act to prohibit_
and restrict the use of certain titles mentioned therein.

54. Clause 79 seeks to introduce a new section 121 A to provide
that any decision made by the Minister under this Act, whether an
original decision by him or a decision on appeal to him from a
decision of the Commission, shall be final.

55. Clause 81 seeks to introduce new sections 122A, 122B and
122C. Section 122A makes the falsification of records by directors,
employees and agents an offence.

Section 122B provides that it shall be an offence for any person,
with intent to deceive, to make or funish any false or misleading
statements to the Commission, stock exchange or recognised clearing
house.

Section 122C deals with attempts, abetments and conspiracies.

56. _Clause 82 seeks to amend sections 123 and 124 of the Act._
The amendment to section 123 seeks to increase the general penalty
and to provide for a daily fine. The amendment to section 124
seeks to transfer the power to compound from the Licensing Officer
to the Commission.

57. _Clause 83 seeks to introduce a new section 126B to impose_
on a recognised clearing house an obligation to have default rules
to enable the taking of action by a recognised clearing house in the
event of a participant being unable, or likely to become unable, to
meet its obligations in respect of unsettled market contracts and
subsection 126B(4) provides that any action taken by the recognised
clearing house in this respect shall not be regarded as invalid on
the ground of inconsistency with the law relating to the distribution
of assets of a person on insolvency, bankruptcy or winding-up, or
on the appointment of a receiver over the assets of such a person.

58. _Clauses 86 to 88 seek to provide general and specific transitional_
and savings provisions. In addition, the Minister is to be given the
power to make such modifications as may appear to him to be
necessary for preventing anomalies.

59. Other proposed amendments to the Act which have not been
specifically referred to are consequential or minor in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN.(U[2]) 1826.]
