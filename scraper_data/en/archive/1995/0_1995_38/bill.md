EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Universities and University Colleges
Act 1971 ("the Act").

1. Clause 1 deals with the short title and seeks to allow the Minister
to appoint the date of commencement of the Act. However the
Minister may by order suspend the operation, or exempt the
application, of the whole or any of the provisions of the Act with
respect to any University or University College established under
the Act.

2. Clause 2 seeks to define the term "appointed date" to mean the
date of coming into force of the Act.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act to introduce
certain new definitions and to amend certain existing definitions
used in the Act, the more significant being as follows:

_(a) the definition of "Board" to refer to the Board of Directors_
of the University as the new executive authority of the
University in place of the University Council;

_(b) the definition of "Faculty" to include School, Centre,_
Academy and Institute of the University; and

_(c) the definition of "Vice-Chancellor" as the chief executive_
officer of the University who may also be styled as the
President, Rector or Director of the University.

4. Clause 4 requires the Minister, in the exercise of his responsibility
for the general direction of higher education and the administration
of the Act under section 3, to act in accordance with the national
policies, strategies and guidelines on higher education formulated
or determined by an authority established under any written law for
such purposes.

5. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 5 of the Act to make reference
to any written law to save higher educational institution established
under such written law.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend subsection 5A(1) to provide for the
non-application of the Act to any private higher educational institution
established and conferred with the status of a University under any
written law.

UNIVERSITIES AND UNIVERSITY COLLEGES 41
(AMENDMENT)

7. Clause 7 is a general amendment to substitute for the reference
to the "University Council" wherever appearing in the Act the reference
to "Board".

8. _Clause 8 seeks to give effect to the change of the executive_
authority of the University from the University Council to the Board
of Directors of the University and to provide that all references to
the old executive authority are to be construed as references to the
new executive authority.

9. Clauses 9 and 10 relate to the rights, privileges, liabilities, duties
and obligations of the University Council, and legal proceedings by
or against the University Council, which are not affected by the
change of executive authority.

10. Clause 11 seeks to provide that all existing liabilities incurred
by the University Council may be enforced against the Board of
Directors of the University.

11. Similarly, clause 12 provides that all land, property and assets
vested in the University Council will, after the date of coming into
force of the Act, vest in the Board of Directors of the University.

12. Clause 13 seeks to add subvention and legacies as monies in
aid of the finances of the University.

13. Clause 16 seeks to amend section 15D by deleting subsection
(9). With this amendment the power to deal with a student who has
been suspended or expelled from a University shall rest solely with
the Minister.

14. Clause 17 seeks to substitute section 16A to provide for a
change of the disciplinary authority. Under the new section 16A the
Board is empowered to appoint different disciplinary committees
in respect of different categories of staff, officers and employees
of the University. A staff, officer or employee who is a member
of a disciplinary committee shall not be lower in rank than any
staff, officer or employee over whom the disciplinary committee
has disciplinary authority. Where a member of a disciplinary committee
is himself a complainant in any disciplinary proceedings, he shall
not be present nor participate in those proceedings. This clause also
specifies a time period of thirty days from the service of the decision
within which an appeal under section 16A of the Act may be made
to the Board.
