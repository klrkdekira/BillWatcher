This Bill seeks to amend the Service Tax Act 1975 ("the Act").

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 12 of the Act to clarify that
the return in the prescribed form shall set out the aggregate amount
of the proceeds received by a taxable person during a particular
taxable period and not the total charges levied by the taxable person
during that particular taxable period.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 14 of the Act to provide that
service tax shall only become due when payment for services or
goods are received. However where payments for services or goods
have not been received within a period of six months from the date
of issue of the invoice for the taxable service provided or the taxable
goods sold or provided, then the service tax shall be due on the
day following that period of six months. Any tax due shall be
payable to the Director General within twenty-eight days following
the expiration of the taxable period.
