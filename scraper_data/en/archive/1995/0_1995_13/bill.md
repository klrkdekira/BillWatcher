TABUNG ANGKATAN TENTERA AND 7

TABUNG BEKAS PERAJURIT (AMENDMENT)

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Tabung Angkatan Tentera and Tabung
Bekas Perajurit Act 1973 ("the Act").

2. _Clause 1 deals with the short title of this Bill._

3. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act by inserting a_
definition of the word "Tabung". This is appropriate as the Tabung
Bekas Perajurit has been wound up and a single fund now exists.

4. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 3 of the Act by substituting
for subsection 3(1) a new subsection (1) and introducing new
subsections (1A), (3) and (4).

The new subsection 3(1) provides for the establishment of a single
fund known as the "Tabung Angkatan Tentera" (hereinafter referred
to as the "Tabung") which is to replace the "Tabung Angkatan
Tentera and Tabung Bekas Perajurit". This single fund has primary
purposes and ancillary purposes. The primary purposes of the Tabung
preserve the existing purposes of the Tabung Angkatan Tentera
which is the provision of superannuation and other benefits to members
of the regular forces who are contributors to the Tabung. The ancillary
purposes are for the promotion of the socio-economic development
and welfare of retiring and retired personnel of the regular forces
of Malaysia.

The new subsection (1 A) provides for the sources of funding of
the Tabung. It includes a new source, which is an annual grant
from the Federal Consolidated Fund. This source of funding is intended
to be applied towards all activities related to the ancillary purposes
of the Tabung including, for defraying administrative and other
expenses incurred by the Lembaga or any other body charged with
the responsibility of undertaking the activities for the ancillary purposes
of the Tabung.

The new subsection (4) seeks to provide that the Lembaga may
only utilise the other monies from the Tabung towards the ancillary
purposes of the Tabung after it has first applied the monies from
the annual grant, and where there are sufficient funds for the Lembaga
to discharge its obligations in respect of its primary purposes, including
a declaration of an annual rate of profit for the superannuation
fund.

5. Clause 8 seeks to delete section 3A of the Act. Section 3A of
the Act which established the Tabung Bekas Perajurit is no longer
necessary since its purposes are now being transferred to the Tabung
Angkatan Tentera.


-----

8 BILL

6. _Clause 13 provides for transfer of property rights and liabilities,_
saving and transitional provisions occasioned by the winding-up of
the Tabung Bekas Perajurit.

7. Other proposed amendments to the Act not specifically referred
to are consequential or minor in nature and are necessitated by the
winding-up of the Tabung Bekas Perajurit.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1872.]
