EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Workmen's Compensation Act 1952
("the Act").

WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION (AMENDMENT) 21

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend the respective provisos to the definitions
of "partial disablement" and "total disablement" to include the new
Part I and Part II of the First Schedule.

3. Clause 3 seeks to introduce a new section 3 A to empower the
Minister to exempt any person or class of persons from all or any
of the provisions of the Act.

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 8 of the Act to increase the
amount of compensation to be awarded in the event of the death,
permanent total disablement, permanent partial disablement or temporary
disablement of a workman resulting from injuries sustained by him.
The present amount awarded is considered inadequate and an increase
of twenty per cent is proposed to take into account inflation trends
owing to the increased standard and cost of living.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 9 of the Act by substituting for_
paragraph (1)(d) a new paragraph. The new paragraph (1) _(d) seeks to_
increase by twenty per cent the average minimum monthly earnings
of a workman in the computation of his true monthly earnings at the
date of the accident involving him.

6. _Clause 6 seeks to amend subsection 10(4) of the Act to increase_
the amount of funeral expenses borne by a dependant of a workman
from RM100.00 to RM1,000.00 as the present amount of RM100.00
provided for funeral expenses is inadequate and unrealistic.

7. _Clause 7 seeks to amend subsection 13(5) of the Act by increasing_
the fines imposed for non-compliance of subsection 13(1) from a
maximum fine of RM1.000.00 for a first offence and RM5.000.00 for
any subsequent offence to a maximum fine of RM5,000.00 for the
first offence and RM10,000.00 for any subsequent offence. The
amendment seeks to deter an employer from contravening subsection
13(1) which imposes upon the employer an obligation to notify the
Commissioner of any accident on his premises in connection with
anything done for the purposes of the employer's trade or business
and which results in the death or the immediate disablement total or
partial of any person injured.

8. _Clause 8 seeks to amend subsection 23(2) of the Act to increase_
the penalty of a maximum fine of RM2,000.00 to RM5,000.00 for
failure to comply with subsection 23(1). The subsection requires every
employer to furnish the Commissioner returns specifying the number
of injuries in respect of which compensation has been paid by the
employer and the amount of the compensation.

9. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 26 of the Act. Subsections 26(2)_
and (3) are new provisions introduced to overcome the problems faced
by a claimant (an injured workment) in relation to claims made against
an insurance company in respect of insurance policies taken out by

his employer. Under subsection 26(1), an employer is at liberty to
insure and keep himself insured in respect of any liability which he
may incur to any workman employed by him with any insurance
company. However, smaller insurance companies which are in a weak
financial position are frequently found to dispute the workman's claim
in order to avoid the claim or delay the payment. To overcome the
problem, the proposed amendments seek to make it mandatory for an
employer to insure himself or keep himself insured under an insurance
scheme which is approved by the Minister. Under the new subsection
26(4), in the event the Minister revokes any order approving such an
insurance scheme, the provisions of subsection 26(1) with regard to
the compulsory insurance shall apply.

10. Clause 10 seeks to amend the First and Second Schedules to the
Act by substituting for the First Schedule a new First Schedule which
is divided into two parts viz. Part I and Part II, and the Second
Schedule with a new Second Schedule which extends the list of
occupational diseases. Part I of the First Schedule lists out the injuries
deemed to result in permanent total disablement whilst Part II, injuries
deemed to result in permanent partial disablement. With these
amendments, the scope of protection afforded to a workman under
the Act is widened considerably.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN.(U[2]) 1898.]
