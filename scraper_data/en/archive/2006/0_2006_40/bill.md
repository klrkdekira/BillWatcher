_Malaysian Biofuel Industry_ 17

and subject in any case to sufficient security being furnished to the
satisfaction of the court that the conveyance, machinery, contrivance

not exceeding two years or to both.

**Sale and disposal of seized fuel**

**28. (1) The enforcement officer may at any time direct that any fuel**

-----

18 _Bill_

**30.** (1) An enforcement officer making an investigation under this
Act may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted
with the facts and circumstances of the case.

(2) Such person shall be bound to answer all questions relating to

such case put to him by the enforcement officer, but he may refuse to
answer any question the answer to which would have a tendency to

(3) A person making a statement under this section shall be legally

bound to state the truth, whether or not such statement is made
wholly or partly in answer to questions.

(4) The enforcement officer examining a person under subsection

and

_(b)_ he has been given an opportunity to make any correction he

may wish.


-----

_Malaysian Biofuel Industry_ 19

**Admissibility of statements in evidence**

**31.** (1) In any trial or inquiry by a court into an offence under this
Act, any statement, whether the statement amounts to a confession or
not, is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after
the person is charged and whether in the course of an investigation
under this Act or not and whether or not wholly or partly in answer to
questions, by an accused person to or in the hearing of an
enforcement officer and whether or not interpreted to him by any
other enforcement officer or any other person, whether concerned or
not in the arrest of that person, shall, notwithstanding any written law
or rule of law to the contrary, be admissible at his trial in evidence
and, if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement
may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching
his credit.

(2) No statement under subsection (1) shall be admissible or used

as provided for in that subsection if the making of the statement
appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or
promise having reference to the charge against the person proceeding
from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to
give that person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for
supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid
any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against
him.

(3) Where any person is arrested or is informed that he may be

prosecuted for any offence under this Act, he shall be served with a
notice in writing, which shall be explained to him, to the following
effect:

"You have been arrested/informed that you may be prosecuted

for .......................(the possible offence under this Act). Do you
wish to say anything? If there is any fact on which you intend to
rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If
you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less
likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in
general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it
written down, this will be done.".

(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), a statement by any person

accused of any offence under this Act made before there is time
to serve a notice under that subsection shall not be rendered
inadmissible in evidence merely by reason of no such notice
having been served on him if such notice has been served on
him as soon as is reasonably possible thereafter.


-----

**20** _Bill_

(5) No statement made by an accused person in answer to a

written notice served on him pursuant to subsection (3) shall be
construed as a statement caused by any inducement, threat or promise
as is described in subsection (2), if it is otherwise voluntary.

(6) Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an

offence under this Act, evidence is given that the accused, on being
informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any
such fact, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time
he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so
informed, the court, in determining whether the prosecution has made
out a prima facie case against the accused and in determining whether
the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inference
from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of
those inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to,
corroboration of any evidence given against the accused in relation to
which the failure is material.

(7) Nothing in subsection (6) shall in any criminal proceedings —

_(a)_ prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or

other reaction of the accused in the face of anything said in
his presence relating to the conduct in respect of which he
is charged, in so far as evidence of it would be admissible
apart from that subsection; or

_(b)_ be taken to preclude the drawing of any inference from any

such silence or other reaction of the accused which could
be drawn apart from that subsection.

**Forfeiture of seized fuel, etc.**

**32. (1) Any fuel or the proceeds of sale thereof, or any conveyance,**
machinery, contrivance, equipment, book, record, document or other
article seized in exercise of any power conferred under this Act shall
be liable to forfeiture.

(2) An order for the forfeiture of the fuel or the proceeds of sale

thereof, or the conveyance, machinery, contrivance, equipment, book,
record, document or other article shall be made if it is proved to the
satisfaction of the court that an offence under this


-----

_Malaysian Biofuel Industry_ 21

Act has been committed and that the fuel or the proceeds of sale
thereof, or the conveyance, machinery, contrivance, equipment, book,
record, document or other article was the subject matter of or was
used in the commission of the offence, even though no person has
been convicted of such offence.

(3) If there is no prosecution with regard to any fuel, or the

proceeds of sale thereof, or any conveyance, machinery, contrivance,
equipment, book, record, document or other article seized under this
Act, such fuel or the proceeds of sale thereof, or any conveyance,
machinery, contrivance, equipment, book, record, document or other
article shall be taken and deemed to be forfeited at the expiration of a
period of one calendar month from the date of service of a notice to
the last known address of the person from whom the fuel or the
proceeds of sale thereof, or any conveyance, machinery, contrivance,
equipment, book, record, document or other article was seized
indicating that there is no prosecution in respect of such fuel or the
proceeds of sale thereof, or any conveyance, machinery, contrivance,
equipment, book, record, document or other article unless before the
expiration of that period a claim thereto is made in the manner set out
in subsections (4), (5), (6) and (7).

(4) Any person asserting that he is the owner of the fuel or the

proceeds of sale thereof, or of the conveyance, machinery,
contrivance, equipment, book, record, document or other article
referred to in subsection (3) and that it is not liable to forfeiture may
personally or by his agent authorized in writing, give written notice to
the enforcement officer in whose possession such fuel or the proceeds
of sale thereof, or the conveyance, machinery, contrivance,
equipment, book, record, document or other article is held that he
claims the fuel or the proceeds of sale thereof, or the conveyance,
