has power to dispose;

_(c)_ enables the object to be identified in conformity with the Protocol;

and

sum secured.

**Chapter III**

Default remedies

_Article 8 — Remedies of chargees_

1. In the event of default as provided in Article 11, the chargee may, to the
extent that the chargor has at any time so agreed and subject to any declaration
that may be made by a Contracting State under Article 54, exercise any one
or more of the following remedies:

_(a)_ take possession or control of any object charged to it;

_(b)_ sell or grant a lease of any such object;

_(c)_ collect or receive any income or profits arising from the management

or use of any such object.


-----

12 _Bill_

2. The chargee may alternatively apply for a court order authorising or

directing any of the acts referred to in the preceding paragraph.

3. Any remedy set out in subparagraph (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1 or by

Article 13 shall be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner. A remedy
shall be deemed to be exercised in a commercially reasonable manner where
it is exercised in conformity with a provision of the security agreement except
where such a provision is manifestly unreasonable.

4. A chargee proposing to sell or grant a lease of an object under paragraph

1 shall give reasonable prior notice in writing of the proposed sale or lease
to:

_(a)_ interested persons specified in Article 1(m)(i) and (ii); and

_(b)_ interested persons specified in Article 1(m)(iii) who have given notice

of their rights to the chargee within a reasonable time prior to the
sale or lease.

5. Any sum collected or received by the chargee as a result of exercise

of any of the remedies set out in paragraph I or 2 shall be applied towards
discharge of the amount of the secured obligations.

6. Where the sums collected or received by the chargee as a result of the

exercise of any remedy set out in paragraph 1 or 2 exceed the amount secured
by the security interest and any reasonable costs incurred in the exercise of
any such remedy, then unless otherwise ordered by the court the chargee shall
distribute the surplus among holders of subsequently ranking interests which
have been registered or of which the chargee has been given notice, in order
of priority, and pay any remaining balance to the chargor.

_Article 9 — Vesting of object in satisfaction; redemption_

1. At any time after default as provided in Article 11, the chargee and all

the interested persons may agree that ownership of (or any other interest of
the chargor in) any object covered by the security interest shall vest in the
chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured obligations.

2. The court may on the application of the chargee order that ownership of

(or any other interest of the chargor in) any object covered by the security
interest shall vest in the chargee in or towards satisfaction of the secured
obligations.

3. The court shall grant an application under the preceding paragraph only

if the amount of the secured obligations to be satisfied by such vesting is
commensurate with the value of the object after taking account of any payment
to be made by the chargee to any of the interested persons.

4. At any time after default as provided in Article 11 and before sale of the
charged object or the making of an order under paragraph 2, the chargor or
any interested person may discharge the security interest by paying in full
the amount secured, subject to any lease granted by the chargee under Article


-----

_International Interests in Mobile Equipment_ 13

_(Aircraft)_

_8(1)(b) or ordered under Article 8(2). Where, after such default, the payment_
of the amount secured is made in full by an interested person other than the
debtor, that person is subrogated to the rights of the chargee.

5. Ownership or any other interest of the chargor passing on a sale under
Article 8(1)(b) or passing under paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article is free from
any other interest over which the chargee's security interest has priority under
the provisions of Article 29.

_Article 10 — Remedies of conditional seller or lessor_

In the event of default under a title reservation agreement or under a leasing
agreement as provided in Article 11, the conditional seller or the lessor, as
the case may be, may:

_(a)_ subject to any declaration that may be made by a Contracting State

under Article 54, terminate the agreement and take possession or
control of any object to which the agreement relates; or

_(b)_ apply for a court order authorising or directing either of these acts.

_Article 11 — Meaning of default_

1. The debtor and the creditor may at any time agree in writing as to the

events that constitute a default or otherwise give rise to the rights and remedies
specified in Articles 8 to 10 and 13.

2. Where the debtor and the creditor have not so agreed, "default" for the
purposes of Articles 8 to 10 and 13 means a default which substantially
deprives the creditor of what it is entitled to expect under the agreement.

_Article 12 — Additional remedies_

Any additional remedies permitted by the applicable law, including any
remedies agreed upon by the parties, may be exercised to the extent that they
are not inconsistent with the mandatory provisions of this Chapter as set out
in Article 15.

_Article 13 — Relief pending final determination_

1. Subject to any declaration that it may make under Article 55, a Contracting
State shall ensure that a creditor who adduces evidence of default by the debtor
may, pending final determination of its claim and to the extent that the debtor
has at any time so agreed, obtain from a court speedy relief in the form of
such one or more of the following orders as the creditor requests:

_(a)_ preservation of the object and its value;

_(b)_ possession, control or custody of the object;

_(c)_ immobilisation of the object; and

_(d)_ lease or, except where covered by subparagraphs (a) to (c), management

of the object and the income therefrom.


-----

# 14 Bill

2. In making any order under the preceding paragraph, the court may impose

such terms as it considers necessary to protect the interested persons in the
event that the creditor:


_(a)_ in implementing any order granting such relief, fails to perform any of

its obligations to the debtor under this Convention or the Protocol;
or

_(b)_ fails to establish its claim, wholly or in part, on the final determination

of that claim.

3. Before making any order under paragraph 1, the court may require notice

of the request to be given to any of the interested persons.

4. Nothing in this Article affects the application of Article 8(3) or limits the

availability of forms of interim relief other than those set out in paragraph
1.

_Article 14 — Procedural requirements_

Subject to Article 54(2), any remedy provided by this Chapter shall be exercised
in conformity with the procedure prescribed by the law of the place where
the remedy is to be exercised.

_Article 15 — Derogation_

In their relations with each other, any two or more of the parties referred
to in this Chapter may at any time, by agreement in writing, derogate from
or vary the effect of any of the preceding provisions of this Chapter except
Articles 8(3) to (6), 9(3) and (4), 13(2) and 14.

**Chapter IV**

registered interest and as if references to a registered or unregistered interest
were references to a registered or unregistered assignment.

to an international interest were references to an assignment of the associated
rights and the related international interest.
