_Street, Drainage and Building (Amendment)_ 11

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Street, Drainage and Building Act 1974 ("Act 133") to
replace the building certification system currently under the purview of local
authority to a new certification system by the private sector. The certificate of
fitness for occupation issued by the local authority will be replaced by a certificate
of completion and compliance to be issued by a Professional Architect,
Professional Engineer or building draughtsman who under this Bill is described as
the principal submitting person.

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provisions on the application and
commencement of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 3 of Act 133, to substitute the definition of
"certificate of fitness for occupation" with the definition of "certificate of
completion and compliance". It also seeks to introduce the following new
definitions in consequence of the introduction of the new certification system:

_(a)_ "building plans" to refer to the plans to be submitted by the principal

submitting person;

_(b)_ "partial certificate of completion and compliance" to replace the definition

of "partial certificate of fitness for occupation";

_(c)_ "principal submitting person" to refer to the qualified person responsible

for submitting the building plans for approval of the local authority and
who will be the person responsible for issuing the certificate of
completion and compliance under the new certification system;

_(d)_ "qualified person" to refer to the category of qualified person recognized

under Act 133; and


_(e)_ "submitting person" to refer to a qualified person who submits plans

other than building plans for approval of the local authority or relevant
statutory authority.

4. _Clauses 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 seek to amend sections 58, 65, 70A,_ 70B, 75 and 85A
of Act 133 respectively consequent to the amendment proposed in clause 2.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 70 of Act 133 to introduce, amongst others,_
provisions relating to the new certification system by the principal submitting
person. Under the present certification system, the local authority issues the
certificate of fitness for occupation of a building pursuant to the provisions of the
Uniform Building By-Laws made under the Act. The proposed new certification
system seeks to allow the principal submitting person to issue a certificate of
completion and compliance. References to the principal submitting person are made
in the proposed amendments to subsections (2), (4), (5), (8), (14), (18) and (19).

The proposed amendment to paragraph (2)(b) seeks to set out clearly that plans and
specification intended in that paragraph cover other requirements than just the
sewerage system. The proposed amendments to subsections (11) and (12)


-----

12 _Bill_

seek to increase the penalties for making alteration to any building and for using
any building for a purpose other than which it was originally constructed for
without prior written permission from the local authority. Penalties provided in
subsection (13) are also proposed to be increased.

In introducing the new certification system, eight new subsections have been
incorporated as follows:

_(a)_ subsection (20) relates to the issuance of certificate of completion and

compliance by the principal submitting person;

_(b)_ subsection (21) relates to the duties and responsibilities of the principal

submitting person;

_(c)_ subsection (22) relates to the powers of the local authority pertaining to

the erection and construction of a building;

_(d)_ subsection (23) empowers the local authority to issue a notice in writing

to the principal submitting person to rectify any non-compliance with the
provisions of Act 133 and any by-laws made thereunder and a directive
to withhold the issuance of the certificate of completion and compliance
until such non-compliance has been rectified;

_(e)_ subsection (24) relates to the powers of the local authority to execute any

work or to take any measure it consider necessary to rectify the noncompliance if the directive mentioned in paragraph _(23)(b)_ is not
complied with by the principal submitting person;


_(f)_ subsections (25) and (26) allows the local authority to recover any costs

incurred by it under subsection (24) from the owner of the building; and

_(g)_ subsection (27) relates to the offences under the new certification system.

6. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 123 of Act 133 to be in line with Clause (3)_
of Article 145 of the Federal Constitution and section 376 of the Criminal
Procedure Code.

7. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend section 127 of Act 133 to increase the general
penalties under the Act. The maximum fine and further fine are increased from two
thousand ringgit to ten thousand ringgit and from one hundred ringgit to five
hundred ringgit respectively.

8. _Clause 12_ seeks to amend section 133 of Act 133 consequent upon the

introduction of the new certification system.

9. _Clause 13_ seeks to provide that all references to the certificate of fitness
for occupation or partial certificate of fitness for occupation in any written law
or document shall, after the proposed Act comes into operation, be construed
as references to the certificate of completion and compliance or partial certificate
of completion and compliance.
