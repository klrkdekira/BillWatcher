EXPLANATORY STATEMENT This Bill seeks

to amend the Legal Profession Act 1976 ("Act 166").

2. _Clause ! contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of_

the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 166 —_

_(a)_ in relation to the definition of "the Board", in consequence of the

amendment to section 4 of Act 166; and

_(b)_ to insert new definitions into Act 166, namely "Faculty of Law" and

"Minister".

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 166 to provide for a change of_
name of the Qualifying Board to that of the Legal Profession Qualifying Board
to reflect the specific functions it assumes. Subclauses 2, 3 and 4 seek to make
transitional and saving provisions to cater for the proposed change of name.


-----

_26_ _Bill_

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 7 of Act 166 to provide for the nomination_
of a full-time member of the academic staff of a Faculty of Law as a member
of the Legal Profession Qualifying Board. Under the existing provision, only
the Dean of a Faculty of Law qualifies as a member.

6. _Clause 7 seeks to amend subsection 13(4) of Act 166 to shorten the period_
an officer must serve in the Judicial and Legal Service, that is from seven years
to at least a year, to qualify for an exemption from serving any period of
pupillage for purposes of his admission as an advocate and solicitor.

7. _Clause 8 seeks to amend paragraph 35(2)(b) consequential to the enactment_
of the Public Trust Corporation Act 1995 and the amendments made to the
Bankruptcy Act 1967 in relation to the change of designation of the officers
appointed under the Acts. Another category of officers who may appear and
plead in all courts in the country are the officers appointed under the Legal Aid
Act 1971 as described in the new paragraph (ba).

8. _Clause 9 seeks to amend subsection 38(1) of Act 166 —_

_(a)_ to avoid any doubt as to the legal capacity of officers such as the

Director General of Legal Aid and Insolvency Officers to institute,
appear in and conduct any proceedings; and

_(b)_ so that any full-time member of the academic staff of any Faculty of

Law, and not just of the Faculty of Law of the University of Malaya,
is excluded from the application of section 37.

9. _Clause 10 seeks to delete paragraph 46\(\)(a) of Act 166. With the proposed_
amendment, the requirement that a person must be or has been an advocate and
solicitor for a period of not less than seven years in order to be eligible for a
membership of the Bar Council or a Bar Committee, or any of the committee
of the Bar Council or a Bar Committee, is removed.

10. _Clause 11 seeks to amend section 64 of Act 166 to refine and clarify the_

provisions relating to the holding of an annual general meeting, in particular
to overcome any difficulty in complying with the requirement on quorum. The
proposed amendments include, among others, the incorporation of five new
subsections as follows:

_(a)_ subsection (3) on requirement of not less than fourteen days notice of

an annual general meeting to members;

_(b)_ subsection (4) on quorum requirement which is five hundred members

of the Malaysian Bar;

_(c)_ subsection (5) on adjournment of an annual general meeting if the

specified quorum is not present. If this adjourned meeting still lacks
quorum, the members present shall constitute the quorum; and

_(d)_ subsection (6) on requirement of not less than seven days notice if any

motion is proposed to be considered at an annual general meeting.


-----

_Legal Profession (Amendment)_ 27

11. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 65 of Act 166. To remove any doubt,_

the meeting held pursuant to this section is now proposed to be referred to as
an extraordinary general meeting. Proposed amendments, among others, are as
follows:

_(a)_ the number of requisitioning members are now increased from fifty to

one hundred and fifty members;

_(b)_ the quorum for an extraordinary general meeting is five hundred members

of the Malaysian Bar; and

_(c)_ if a quorum is not present, the meeting shall be dissolved.

12. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 66 of Act 166 to specifically provide_

that every member shall have a vote each in an annual general meeting and an
extraordinary general meeting.

13. _Clause 14 seeks to delete section 67 of Act 166. The proposed amendments_

to clauses 11 and 12 render this provision no longer necessary.

14. _Clause 15 seeks to amend section 70 of Act 166 which deals with annual_

general meeting of a State Bar. This clause seeks to make similar amendments
as that in respect of an annual general meeting of the Malaysian Bar.

15. _Clause 16 seeks to amend section 70A of Act 166, also to make amendments_

pertaining to an extraordinary general meeting of a State Bar similar to those
provided for at the national level.

16. _Clause 17 seeks to preserve the validity of acts or things done by the Bar_

Council, etc., pursuant to any decision taken or resolution passed at or subsequent
to any annual general meeting which lacked quorum before the commencement
of the proposed Act.

17. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 76 of Act 166. A significant change_

proposed is the insertion of a new subsection (3) which provides that members
of the Qualifying Board, the Bar Council, the State Bar Committee, etc. shall
not be compelled to disclose to the courts any information relating to any
proceedings or matters conducted by them,

18. _Clause 19 seeks to amend section 93 of Act 166. Among others, the_

proposed amendments introduce new subsections (4c) and (4D). The new subsection
(4c) requires the chairman of the Disciplinary Board, the President of the
Malaysian Bar or his representative to disqualify himself from deliberating in
the Disciplinary Board if he considers that he ought to do so in the interest of
justice. The new subsection (4D) states specifically that no act or proceedings
of the Disciplinary Board shall be invalidated solely because the President of
the Malaysian Bar or his representative has participated in the deliberation of
the Disciplinary Board where the Bar Council is the complainant.

19. _Clause 20 seeks to amend subsection 94(2) of Act 166 to confer additional_

penal powers to the Disciplinary Board in the form of imposing fine on or
reprimanding an advocate and solicitor who has been found guilty of any
misconduct.


-----

28 _Bill_

20. _Clause 21 seeks to amend section 95 of Act 166 in consequence of the_

deletion of section 97 of Act 166.

21. _Clause 22 seeks to delete section 97 of Act 166 to shorten the proceedings_

under Part VII of the Act in order to expedite the completion of any disciplinary
proceedings. At present, investigation is initiated by an Investigating Tribunal
upon a written application or complaint made to the Disciplinary Board and will
be followed by a formal investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. The
proposed discontinuance of the functions of the Investigating Tribunal would
pave the way for the implementation of a single tier system on investigation
of disciplinary misconduct as specified in clause 30.

22. _Clause 23 seeks to amend section 98 of Act 166 to allow the Bar Council_

to appoint such staff to assist the Director of the Complaint Secretariat. This
_clause also clarifies that the Director is to serve as a Secretary only to the_
Disciplinary Board.

23. _Clause 24 seeks to introduce new subsections 99(4) and (5) into Act 166_

to deal with any complaint made against a legal firm.

24. _Clause 25 seeks to substitute section 100 of Act 166 to deal with the_

Disciplinary Board's role before a Disciplinary Committee is appointed and in
instances where no Disciplinary Committee is appointed.

_25._ _Clauses 26 and 27 seek to delete sections 101 and 102 of Act 166 in_

consequence of the deletion of section 97 in clause 22.

26. _Clause 28 seeks to substitute section 103 of Act 166 to empower the_

Disciplinary Board to order that an advocate and solicitor who has been ordered
to pay a fine and defaulted to do so be suspended from practice, and as to an
advocate and solicitor who is currently not in the possession of a practising
certificate, that no Sijil Annual be issued to him until he makes the payment.

27. _Clause 29 seeks to substitute section 103A of Act 166 to deal with the_

membership and appointment of the Disciplinary Committee.

28. _Clause 30 seeks to substitute section 103B of Act 166. The new section_

103B introduces a single tier system in investigation into any complaint against
an advocate and solicitor which is to be carried out only by the Disciplinary
Committee. This clause also lays down the guidelines and procedures of
investigation for the Disciplinary Committee.

29. _Clause 31 seeks to substitute section 103c of Act 166 to deal with the_

findings and recommendations of the Disciplinary Committee.

30. _Clause 32 seeks to substitute section 103D of Act 166 to allow the Disciplinary_

Board to accept or reject the findings or recommendations made by the Disciplinary
Committee.

31. _Clause 33 seeks to substitute section 103E of Act 166.  The substituted_

section seeks to provide that an appeal from the decision of the Disciplinary
Board shall be heard by a single Judge of the High Court and that further


-----

_Legal Profession (Amendment)_ 29

appeals lie to the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court. It is proposed that
the Disciplinary Board is not to be cited as a party in any appeal and that it
be given the right to appear in and address the High Court, the Court of Appeal
and the Federal Court in any appeal by an advocate and solicitor.

32. _Clause 34 seeks to delete section 103G as it is no longer relevant. Saving_

and transitional provisions on disciplinary proceedings pending before the
Disciplinary Board and disciplinary appeals pursuant to section 103E before the
commencement of the proposed Act are provided for in clause 35.

33. _Clause 39 seeks to amend section 111 of Act 166 to extend the protection_

from any actions or proceedings in courts to the State Bar Committee and also
to the Disciplinary Board for the pronouncement or publication of its decision.

34. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are

amendments which are minor or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
