for ...................... (the possible offence under this Act). Do
you wish to say anything? If there is any fact on which you
intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to
mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your

be done.".

accused of any offence under this Act made before there is time

offence under this Act, evidence is given that the accused, on
being informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention
any such fact, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at

so informed, the court, in determining whether the prosecution has
made out a prima facie case against the accused and in determining
whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw
such inference from the failure as appear proper; and the failure
may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable
of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given against the
accused in relation to which the failure is material.

_(a) prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or_

other reaction of the accused in the face of anything said

in his presence relating to the conduct in respect of whichhe is charged, in so far as evidence of it would be admissible
