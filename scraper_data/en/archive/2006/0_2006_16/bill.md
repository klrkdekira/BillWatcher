EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 1958 ("Act
519").

_2._ _Clause I contains the short title and the provision on the commencement_

of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2(a) seeks to amend subparagraph 30(i)(bb)(i) of Act 519 to_

distinguish between securities issued under this subparagraph which are for
non-monetary purposes and securities issued under the new subparagraph
_30(l)(bbb)(i). Clause 2(a)(u) seeks to amend the proviso of subparagraph_
_30(l)(bb)(i) of Act 519 to reduce the monetary limit for securities issued_
under subparagraph 3Q(l)(bb)(i) to fifty percent of the Bank's General Reserve
Fund. A lower financial limit is imposed consequent to the proposed insertion
of a new paragraph 30(\)(bbb) into Act 519 to govern the issuance of Bank
Negara Malaysia securities for monetary policy purposes. Clause 2(b) seeks
to insert a new paragraph 30(l)(bbb) into Act 519 for the issuance of Bank
Negara Malaysia securities for the conduct of monetary policy operations. The
issuance of these securities is expected to enhance diversification of instruments
available for monetary policy operations and allow operational flexibility in
liquidity management. The Bank will have the discretion to determine the
terms for the issuance, holding and sale of such securities provided that the
total amount issued does not at any time exceed the amount of the Bank's
reserve of external assets. Under the new subparagraph 30(l)(bbb)(\\), the
Bank is also empowered to purchase, sell and redeem securities issued under
subparagraph 30(l)(bbb)(\) in carrying out monetary policy operations.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend the shoulder note to section 30A of Act 519 and_

to widen the scope of the application of the section to empower the Bank to
establish a body corporate for the purposes of providing financial counselling,
debt management services and education on financial management.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This  Bill will  not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
