EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Co-operative Societies Act 1993 ("Act 502") pursuant
to the proposed Malaysia Co-operative Societies Commission Bill 2006 (MCSC
Bill).

1. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint the_

commencement date of the proposed Act.

2. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend the long title of Act 502 to provide for the co
operative values of honesty, trustworthiness and transparency as the guiding
principles of the co-operative society movement. The objective of the Act is also
extended to include contributing towards achieving the socio-economic objectives
of the nation.

3. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 502 to introduce new definitions and_

to amend definitions of certain terms used in the Act.

4. _Clause 5 seeks to delete section 3 of Act 502 as the functions of the Registrar_

General and Registrar will be taken over by the Malaysia Co-operative Societies
Commission established under the proposed MCSC Bill.

5. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 5 of Act 502 to reduce the minimum number_

of co-operative society members from one hundred to fifty.

6. _Clause_ 7 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 502 to prescribe different

requirements for the registration of primary, secondary and tertiary society.

7. _Clause 8 is a consequential amendment as the function of the Registrar is taken_

over by the Commission.

8. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce new sections 10A and 10B into Act 502. The new_

section 10A makes it an offence for any person, unless registered, to hold himself
out as a co-operative society or represent that he or any person is carrying on the
business of a co-operative society in any form or manner.

The new section 10B replaces section 89 of Act 502 and makes it an offence for

any person other than a co-operative society to use the words _"koperasi",_
_"koperatif, "co-operative society" or "co-op"._

9. _Clause 10_ seeks to amend section 12 of Act 502 by substituting for the

words "places of business" the word "branches" which carries wider meaning
under the proposed Act.

10. _Clause 11 seeks to amend section 13 of Act 502 to ensure closer supervision_

on co-operative society and to promote transparency in the management of cooperative society. It also makes it an offence for failure to comply with the
provision of this section.

11. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 14 of Act 502 by deleting the requirement_

for the minutes of Board meetings to be lodged with the Commission to reduce the
lodging of unnecessary documents with the Commission. These minutes are


-----

_Co-operative Societies (Amendment)_ 57

only to be submitted when required by the Commission. A penalty provision is
inserted for the non-compliance of this requirement.

12. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 17 of Act 502. The new subsection (2) is_

inserted to empower the Commission, at any time, to require the by-laws of cooperative society to contain provisions on secrecy or permitted disclosures.

13. _Clause 14 seeks to introduce a new section 17A into Act 502 for the purpose_

of streamlining all co-operative society by-laws with Act 502.

14. _Clause 15 seeks to amend subsection 18(4) of Act 502, which provides that_

any appeal against the Commission's refusal to register any amendment of the bylaws may be made to the Minister within three month from the date of the refusal.

15. _Clause 16_ seeks to amend section 18A of Act 502 to empower the

Commission to direct a co-operative society to convene a general meeting to amend
any inconsistent by-laws upon receiving notification made by its Board under
subsection 17A(3) of Act 502.

16. _Clause 77 seeks to substitute section 19 of Act 502 with a new provision to_

monitor the formation of subsidiaries of co-operative society and the movement of
funds in any form from the co-operative society to their subsidiaries. It also makes
it an offence for failure to comply with the provision of this section.

17. _Clause 18 seeks to introduce a new section 19A into Act 502 to require a co-_

operative society to obtain prior written approval of the Commission for opening of
branches in or outside Malaysia. The proposed new section would enable the
Commission to monitor the opening of branches of co-operative society. A penalty
provision is inserted for non-compliance of this section.

18. _Clause 19 seeks to delete section 20 of Act 502 to allow members to dispose_

off produce other than through co-operative society.

19. _Clauses 20, 21 and 22 seek to amend sections 22, 23 and 24 of Act 502 to_

insert the word "return" in the provisions of these sections to cater for Islamic
transactions carried out by any co-operative society.

20. _Clause 23 seeks to amend section 25 of Act 502 by substituting for the word_

"minor" the word "child" to streamline Act 502 with the Child Act 2001 [Act 611].

21. _Clause 24_ seeks to delete section 29 of Act 502 to remove the current

restriction on members to join more than one co-operative society that provide
credit to its members.

22. _Clause 25_ seeks to amend the shoulder note of section 31 of Act 502 by

substituting for the word "Representation" the word "Voting" as the latter word is
more appropriate in explaining the contents of the provision.

contract entered by a child who is a member of a co-operative society.

24. _Clause 27_ seeks to introduce a new section 34A into Act 502 to delimit the

liability of a member of a co-operative society to the nominal value of his
subscription of shares. Where in the by-laws of a co-operative society the amount of
the liability of a member is expressed to be greater than the nominal value of any
shares held or subscribed for by him, then the liability of the member shall extend to
such greater amount.

25. _Clause 28 seeks to amend section 35 of Act 502 to tie the liability of a past_

member of a co-operative society to the limitation provided in section 34A.

this section.

30. _Clause 34 seeks to substitute section 42 of Act 502 with a new provision for_
