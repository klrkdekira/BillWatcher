_Bill_

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT This Bill seeks


to amend the Strata Titles Act 1985 ("Act 318";.

1. _Clause 1_ contains the short title. It also seeks to empower the Minister

to appoint a date of coming into operation of the Act and to appoint different
dates for the coming into operation of different provisions of Act 318.

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend the long title to allow for the subdivision of land into_

land parcels. Before the proposed amendment, only buildings could be subdivided
into parcels for the issue of strata titles but with the proposed amendment, land with
buildings of not more than four storeys can also be subdivided into land parcels for
the issue of strata titles.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to amend the preamble to extend the application of Act 318 to_

the Federal Territory of Putrajaya.

4. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 318 to substitute certain definitions_

and to introduce new definitions.

5. _Clause 6 seeks to introduce new section 4A into Act 318. The new section 4A_

provides for the coming into operation of the Computerization System of Strata
Titles in the Land Registry. The date is appointed by the Minister with the approval
of the National Land Council.

6. _Clause 7 seeks to amend the heading of Part II of Act 318 to include the word_

"land". The amendment is to enable land with buildings to be subdivided into land
parcels.

7. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 318 to enable multi storey buildings_

or two or more buildings having not more than four storeys on the same lot to be
subdivided into land parcels for the issue of strata titles. Before the proposed
amendment, strata titles could only be issued for multi storey buildings and single
storey buildings on the same lot. The amendment will be able to meet the needs of
the new housing development concept referred to as Gated Community Schemes.

8. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 7 of Act 318 to allow the original proprietor of_

any alienated land where there is any building or land which is capable of being
subdivided into parcels to apply for the subdivision.

9. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 8 of Act 318 to stipulate the circumstances in_

which it is compulsory for an original proprietor to apply for a subdivision of a
building or land within the time spelt out in subsections (2) and (4).

10. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend subsection 9(1) of Act 318 to allow for an

application to be made to obtain strata titles for buildings which have been
classified under this Act as special buildings. These buildings have been occupied
before June 1996 but applications for strata titles could not be made as either
the buildings have not been issued with Certificate of Fitness for Occupation
(CFO) or the building plans are lost or destroyed.

thousand ringgit to five thousand ringgit whilst for a continuing offence, the fine is
increased from fifty ringgit to five hundred ringgit for each day.

16. _Clause 17 seeks to amend subparagraph \5(2)(b)(i) of Act 318 to include in a_

statement in Form 3 all express conditions and restrictions-in-interest which
appeared on the registered document of title to the lot at the time the statement was
authenticated by the Registrar. The proposed amendment to subsection (4) is to
state clearly that no account shall be taken of any caveat for the purposes of the
statement in Form 3.

17. _Clause 19 seeks to amend section 20 of Act 318 to make it compulsory for_

the proprietor of a provisional strata title to apply for the issue of separate strata
titles to the parcels in the completed buildings within six months after a certificate
of completion and compliance is issued.

18. _Clause 20_ seeks to amend section 22B of Act 318 to increase the fine for

failure by the proprietor to pay any amount demanded pursuant to subsection 21(2)
of the Act. The proposed increase is from one thousand ringgit to five thousand
ringgit whilst for a continuing offence, the fine is increased from fifty ringgit to
five hundred ringgit for each day.

which cannot at present be ascertained.
