EXPLANATORY STATEMENT This Bill seeks to amend

the Registration of Engineers Act 1967 ("Act 138").

_2._ _Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of the_

proposed Act.

3. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 138 to further provide in respect of_

the functions of the Board. In the proposed clause 4(l)(ef), the Board may appoint a
body to advise the Government and the public on matters relating to engineering
education, including the certification of such programmes.

4. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 7A of Act 138 by increasing the penalty which_

can be imposed by the Board on a sole proprietorship, partnership or body
corporate which practises as an Engineering consultancy practice who fails to
comply with the provisions of the Act.

5. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new Part IIIA that deals with the establishment,_

powers and conduct of proceedings of a Disciplinary Committee. Under the new
Part IIIA, the Disciplinary Committee is empowered to conduct a hearing of any
misconduct or complaint made against any registered Engineer and the Disciplinary
Committee may make an order under section 15 against the registered Engineer.


-----

10 _Bill_

The new subsection 14c has been introduced to ensure that no element of bias exists
against a registered Engineer or an Engineering consultancy practice of which he is
a sole proprietor, partner, director, shareholder or employee, when a hearing
involving any misconduct or complaint against that registered Engineer is being
conducted. The new subsection 14c provides that where a member of the Board has
been appointed as a member of the Disciplinary Committee to conduct a hearing
against a registered Engineer, that member of the Disciplinary Committee shall not
sit as a member of the Board when it conducts a hearing under section 7A against an
Engineering consultancy practice of which that registered Engineer is a sole
proprietor, partner, director, shareholder or employee.

6. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 15 of Act 138 by replacing the Board with_

the Disciplinary Committee as being the body empowered to make orders against a
registered Engineer who is found guilty under any of the circumstances stated in
paragraphs _(a)_ to _(o)_ of that section. The offences stipulated in paragraph _(a)_ are
extended to include an offence involving the false or negligent certification by a
registered Engineer. Under the proposed amendments, the Disciplinary Committee
may impose an order that includes an increased fine of fifty thousand ringgit and an
increased period of suspension of registration of two years.

7. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend section 17 of Act 138 to further provide that the

Board may reinstate the registration of a registered Engineer, other than a Graduate
Engineer, or Engineering consultancy practice who fails to renew his or its
registration, upon paying the prescribed fees and satisfying such conditions as may
be determined by the Board.

8. _Clauses 14_ and _16_ seek to enhance the penalties that may be imposed under

sections 24 and 25, respectively, of the Act. Section 24 of the Act is amended by
increasing the fine for offences committed under that section to fifty thousand
ringgit, while the general penalty for offences committed under subsection 25(1) of
the Act is enhanced to ten thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding one year, or to both.

9. _Clause 19 contains saving and transitional provisions._

10. Any amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement involve

amendments that are consequential or minor in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
