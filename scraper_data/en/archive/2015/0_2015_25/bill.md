EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Prevention of Crime Act 1959 (“Act 297”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.


-----

8 _Bill_

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend the long title of Act 297 to clarify that Act
297 applies to terrorists while _clause 3_ seeks to introduce the definition of
“terrorist” into subsection 2(1) of Act 297. These amendments are required to
clarify that Act 297 will continue to apply to terrorist acts other than those
covered by the proposed Prevention of Terrorism Act 2015 [Act ...]. In this
regard, the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2015 will specifically deal with the
prevention of the commission or support of terrorist acts involving listed
terrorist organizations, as defined in that Act, in a foreign country or any part
of a foreign country and the control of persons engaged in such acts.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 297 to introduce a new subsection_
(1a) to require a police officer to refer the case of the person arrested to the
Public Prosecutor for direction not more than seven days from the date of
arrest.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 297 to introduce new subsections_
(2a), (4) and (5). Subsection (2a) provides the safeguard that no person shall
be arrested and detained under section 4 solely for his political belief or
political activity while subsection (5) defines the expression “political belief or
political activity” in line with the definition of that expression in the Security
Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 [Act 747]. Subsection (4) empowers
the Public Prosecutor to appear in any application made under section 4.

6. _Clause 6_ seeks to substitute section 7b of Act 297 to provide parity
between the Prevention of Crime Board and the Prevention of Terrorism
Board established under the proposed Prevention of Terrorism Act 2015. The
Prevention of Crime Board shall continue to sit as a single Board with a
quorum for its sitting being three members. This amendment is intended to
facilitate the sittings of the Prevention of Crime Board.

7. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 9 of Act 297 to introduce a new subsection_
(7) to empower the Minister to prescribe the allowances to be paid to witnesses
summoned under subsection 9(3) by regulations made under Act 297.

8. _Clause 9 seeks to amend subsection 15a(2) of Act 297 by inserting a new_
paragraph _(ba) to clarify that judicial review includes proceedings instituted_
by way of a writ of _habeas corpus._

9. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 19a of Act 297 by inserting a new_
subsection (4). The purpose of this amendment is for the avoidance of any doubt
as to the application of Article 151 of the Federal Constitution to detention
orders issued under section 19a. The new subsection (4) seeks to clarify that
as provided by Article 151 of the Federal Constitution, where any law made
under Article 149 of the Federal Constitution provides for preventive detention,
any person detained under that law shall be given the opportunity of making
representations against the detention order as soon as may be to an advisory
board constituted under Clause (2) of Article 151. The procedures for making
such representation have been provided in regulations made under Act 297.

10. _Clause 11 seeks to amend subsections 19c(2) and (4) of Act 297 to_

correct cross references.


-----

_Prevention of Crime (Amendment)_ 9

11. _Clause 12 seeks to amend Act 297 by substituting sections 19e and 19f._

This removes the requirement for the Minister of Home Affairs to submit
annual reports to Parliament of all the activities under Part IVa (Detention
Orders) under Act 297 and the requirement for Part IVa to be reviewed every
five years by the Parliament. In their place, the new section 19e empowers
the Board to direct the removal of a detained person from any place of
detention to another place of detention while the new section 19f empowers
the Commissioner General of Prison or the Inspector General of Police, as
the case may be, to order the production of a detained person for the purpose
of any public or other inquiry, or in the national interest, or in the interests
of the person detained, in custody or confined.

12. _Clause 13 seeks to amend Act 297 by introducing a new section 19g._

Section 19g provides that the detention of any person under Part IVa of
Act 297 shall be without prejudice to the taking of any criminal proceeding
against that person, whether during or after the period of his detention.

13. _Clause 14 seeks to amend section 21 of Act 297 to remove the power_

of the Registrar to destroy photographs and finger impressions where no
application is made for them by the person whose photographs and finger
impressions have been taken under section 21.

14. _Clause 15 seeks to amend section 23 of Act 297. The new paragraph_

(2)(bb) provides that regulations may be made by the Minister for the
administration and management of the Board, including provisions on training
for the members of the Board. Subsection (3) is deleted to provide parity with
the regulation-making powers under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2015.

15. Other amendments not specifically mentioned in this Statement are minor

or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
