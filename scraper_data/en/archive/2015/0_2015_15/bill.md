the company on account of wages, salary or vacation leave out
of money advanced by a person for that purpose, the person by

to the amount by which the sum in respect of which the employee
would have been entitled to priority in the winding up has been

diminished by reason of the payment, and shall have the same
right of priority in respect of that amount as the employee would
have had if the payment had not been made.

been received by the company or the liquidator from the insurer,
the amount shall, after deducting any expenses of or incidental
to getting in the amount, be paid by the liquidator to the third
party in respect of whom the liability was incurred to the extent
necessary to discharge that liability or any part of that liability
remaining undischarged in priority to all payments in respect of
the debts referred to in subsection (1).

the purpose of reconstruction or of amalgamation with
another company and the right to the compensation has

on the reconstruction or amalgamation been preserved to
the person entitled thereto, or where the company has
entered into a contract with an insurer in respect of any
liability under any law relating to workers compensation;

an indemnity for costs of litigation given by certain creditors,
or have been protected or preserved by the payment of moneys
or the giving of indemnity by creditors, or where expenses in
relation to which a creditor has indemnified a liquidator, have
been recovered, the Court may make such order as it deems just
with respect to the distribution of those assets and the amount of
those expenses so recovered with a view to giving those creditors
an advantage over others in consideration of the risk run by the
creditors in so doing.

(10) Subject to this Act, all debts proved in a winding up shall
be paid _pari passu._

onerous covenants;

_(b)_ shares in corporations;

_(c)_ unprofitable contracts; or

_(d)_ any other property that is unsaleable, or not readily

saleable, by reason of its binding the possessor of the

the liquidator of the company, notwithstanding that he has
endeavoured to sell or has taken possession of the property or


-----

_Companies_ 467

exercised any act of ownership in relation to the property, may,
with the leave of the Court or committee of inspection and
subject to this section, in writing signed by him, at any time
within twelve months after the commencement of the winding
up or such extended period as is allowed by the Court, disclaim
the property.

(2) Where any such property under subsection (1) has not
come to the knowledge of the liquidator within thirty days from
the commencement of the winding up, the power of disclaiming
may be exercised at any time within twelve months after he
has become aware of the property or such extended period as is
allowed by the Court.

(3) The disclaimer shall operate to determine, as from the date
of disclaimer, the rights, interest and liabilities of the company
and the property of the company in or in respect of the property
disclaimed, but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the
purpose of releasing the company and the property of the company
from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

(4) The Court or committee before or on granting leave to
disclaim may require such notices to be given to persons interested,
and impose such terms as a condition of granting leave, and make

application in writing has been made to the liquidator by any
person interested in the property requiring him to decide whether
he will or will not disclaim, and the liquidator has not, within a
period of twenty eight days from the receipt of the application or
such further period as is allowed by the Court or committee, given
notice to the applicant that he intends to apply to the Court or

the liquidator after such an application in writing does not within
that period or further period disclaim the contract, the liquidator
shall be deemed to have adopted it.

(6) The Court may, on the application of a person who is, as
against the liquidator, entitled to the benefit or subject to the
burden of a contract made with the company, make an order
rescinding the contract on such terms as to the payment by or to
either party of damages for the non-performance of the contract,


-----

468 _Bill_

or otherwise as the Court thinks just, and any damages payable
under the order to that person may be proved by him as a debt
in the winding up.

(7) The Court may, on the application of a person who either—

_(a)_ claims any interest in any disclaimed property; or

_(b)_ is under any liability not discharged by this Act in respect

of any disclaimed property,

and on hearing such persons as it thinks fit, make an order for
the vesting of the property in or the delivery of the property to
any person entitled to the property, or to whom it seems just
that the property should be delivered by way of compensation
for such liability, or a trustee for him, and on such terms as the
Court thinks just.

(8) On the lodgement of an office copy of the vesting order
with the Registrar and with the Official Receiver and if the order
relates to land, with the appropriate authority concerned with
the recording or registration of dealings in that land, as the case
requires, the property comprised in the order shall vest accordingly
in the person named in the order in that behalf without any further
conveyance, transfer or assignment.

(9) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (7) and (8), where
the property disclaimed is of a leasehold nature, the Court shall
not make a vesting order in favour of any person claiming under
the company, whether as under-lessee or as mortgagee, except
upon the terms of making that person—

_(a)_ subject to the same liabilities and obligations as those

to which the company was subject under the lease in
respect of the property at the commencement of the
winding up; or

_(b)_ if the Court thinks fit, subject only to the same liabilities

and obligations as if the lease had been assigned to that
person at that date,

and in either event, if the case so requires, as if the lease had
comprised only the property comprised in the vesting order,
and any mortgagee or under-lessee declining to accept a vesting


-----

_Companies_ 469

order upon those terms shall be excluded from all the interest
in and the security upon the property, and, if there is no person
claiming under the company who is willing to accept an order
upon those terms, the Court may vest the estate and interest of
the company in the property in any person liable personally or
in a representative character and either alone or jointly with the
company to perform the lessee’s covenants in the lease, freed
and discharged from all the estates, encumbrances and interest
created in the vesting order by the company.

(10) Any person aggrieved by the operation of a disclaimer

the Minister or Official Receiver, direct that person to comply with
the requirements of that subsection, and where any application is
made under this subsection with respect to a liquidator, the Court
may, unless it appears that the failure or neglect to comply was
due to the liquidator not having in his hands sufficient assets of
the company to enable him so to do, direct that the costs of the
application shall be borne by the liquidator personally.

(9) The Minister may direct that the whole or any part of
any costs and expenses properly incurred by the liquidator in
