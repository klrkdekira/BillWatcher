-----

_Employees Provident Fund (Amendment)_ 13

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to substitute section 27 of Act 452.

The proposed subsection 27(1) seeks to require the Board, with the approval

of the Minister, to declare dividend on contribution to the Fund. In respect
of contributions made by the members of the Fund who have not elected
for their accounts to be managed according to Shariah under the proposed
section 43a or who have made the elections under the proposed section 43a
but the elections have not come into effect, the Board shall declare any rate
of dividend according to the actual performance of the investment made by
the Board in relation to the accounts which shall not be less than two and one
half per centum per annum. In respect of contributions made by the members
of the Fund whose elections for their accounts to be managed according to
Shariah under the proposed section 43a have come into effect, the Board
shall declare dividend at any rate according to the actual performance of the
investment made by the Board in relation to the accounts.

The proposed subsections 27(2) and (3) are the existing provisions of

section 27 which have been redrafted for the purposes of clarity. The proposed
subsection 27(2) seeks to provide that the dividend declared in accordance
with the proposed subsection 27(1) shall be payable on contributions to the
Fund according to the accounts of the members of the Fund respectively.
The proposed subsection 27(3) seeks to prohibit the declaration of any rate
of dividend exceeding two and one half per centum per annum in certain
situations.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 43 of Act 452 to provide for the minimum_
monthly contributions of every employee and employer who are subject to the
minimum wages order made under the National Wages Consultative Council
Act 2011 [Act 732] which shall not be less than the monthly contributions
based on the amount of the minimum wages for the month as determined
under the minimum wages order at the rate respectively set out in the Third
Schedule.

8. _Clause 7_ seeks to introduce a new section 43a into Act 452 to allow a
member of the Fund to elect for all amounts standing to the credit of his
account to be managed in accordance with Shariah subject to the prescribed
terms and conditions. However, the election shall take effect only from the
date as determined by the Board. The Board is required to notify the effective
date of the election so determined to the member of the Fund not less than
seven days before the effective date. The member of the Fund who has made
the election may revoke the election at any time before the effective date
of the election. After the election is effective, the Board shall segregate the
account of the member of the Fund for the purpose of managing the account
according to Shariah.

9. _Clause 8_ seeks to amend subsection 45(3) of Act 452 to provide that
where an employer fails to pay any contributions due within such period as
may be prescribed by the Minister, the employer shall, in addition to such
contributions, be liable to pay dividend on such contributions at the rate and
in accordance with any manner and calculation determined by the Board.


-----

14 _Bill_

10. _Clause 9_ seeks to amend subsection 46(2) of Act 452 to provide for the

definitions of “contribution” and “partner”.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 49 of Act 452 to provide that if the_

monthly contribution is not paid within the prescribed period, the employer
shall be liable to pay late payment charges on such amount at such rate and
in accordance with any manner and calculation determined by the Board. The
existing provision imposes “interest” on the contribution which is not paid
within the prescribed period. However, since the contribution could be from
the accounts of the members of the Fund whose elections for their accounts to
be managed according to Shariah under the proposed section 43a have come
into effect or otherwise, the words “late payment charges” are used instead of
the word “interest” so that the words used could be applicable to all accounts.

12. _Clause 11 seeks to amend paragraph 50(2b)(b) of Act 452 to provide that_

dividend shall be credited on any amount standing to the credit of a member
of the Fund until all sums of money standing to the credit of such member
are transferred to the Registrar of Unclaimed Money as provided under the
proposed subsection 51a(1). The existing provision of paragraph 50(2b)(b)
disallows dividend to be credited into the account of a member after he has
attained the age of seventy-five years.

13. _Clause 12_ seeks to introduce a new subsection 51(2) into Act 452 to

provide that the amount standing to the credit of a member of the Fund under
paragraph 51(1)(c) of Act 452 as renumbered by this proposed amendment may
be forfeited if the amount standing to the credit of such member is subject
to an order of forfeiture by a court under the Anti-Money Laundering, AntiTerrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 [Act 613].

14. _Clause 13_ seeks to amend subsection 51a(1) of Act 452 to increase the

age limit for the purpose of transferring all sums of money standing to the
credit of a member of the Fund which have not been claimed to the Registrar
of Unclaimed Money from the existing age of eighty years to one hundred
years or at any age limit as may be prescribed by the Board, whichever is
higher.

15. _Clause 14_ seeks to amend section 54c of Act 452.

_Subclause 14(a) seeks to introduce a new subsection 54c(2a) into Act 452_

to limit the withdrawal made under subsection 54c(1) or (2) by a member of
the Fund who is a pensionable employee to only once.

_Subclause 14(b) seeks to delete subsection 54c(3) of Act 452 to remove_

the provision that where a member of the Fund has made a withdrawal under
subsection 54c(1) or (2), he shall not be treated as an employee under Act 452
unless certain requirements are met. This proposed amendment will enable a
person who has made the withdrawal under subsection 54c(1) or (2) and opted
out from the service of the Government of Malaysia, any State Government
or any statutory or local authority to be treated as an employee under
Act 452 if the person opts to join the service of the Government of Malaysia,
any State Government or any statutory or local authority again.

_Employees Provident Fund (Amendment)_ 15

16. _Clause 15_ seeks to introduce a new section 55b into Act 452 to provide

that any contribution that has been credited into the account of a member of
the Fund after the member has attained the age of fifty-five years may only
be withdrawn when the member attains the age of sixty years or such other
age as may be prescribed by the Minister by order published in the _Gazette,_
whichever is higher.

17. _Clause 16_ seeks to introduce a new subsection 59(1a) into Act 452 to

provide that if any person or member of the Fund has made an application
for withdrawal for a particular purpose and charged with an offence under
subsection 59(1) in relation to that application, the Board may not authorize
another application for withdrawal by the person or the member of the Fund
for the same purpose until the charge is disposed of in due course of law.

18. _Clauses 17 and 18 seek to amend subsections 65(3) and 66(2) of Act 452_

respectively to clarify that the word “contribution” referred to in those sections
shall be deemed to include “late payment charges”. The existing provisions
defined “contribution” to include “interest”. However, since the contribution
could be from the accounts of the members of the Fund whose elections for their
accounts to be managed according to Shariah under the proposed section 43a
have come into effect or otherwise, the words “late payment charges” are used
instead of the word “interest” so that the words used could be applicable to
all accounts.

19. _Clause 19 seeks to introduce a new section 69a into Act 452 to provide_

for the application of the Public Authorities Protection Act 1948 [Act 198].

20. _Clause 20_ seeks to amend section 70c of Act 452.

_Paragraph 20(b)(iii) seeks to introduce a new paragraph 70c(1)(d) as_

renumbered by this proposed amendment into Act 452 to empower the Board
to authorize the withdrawal of all amount standing to the credit of a member
of the Fund who is not a Malaysian citizen if he has attained the age of
fifty-five years.

_Subclause 20(c) seeks to introduce new subsections 70c(2) and (3) into_

Act 452. The proposed subsection 70c(2) seeks to provide that where a
member of the Fund who is not a Malaysian citizen has made a withdrawal
of all amount standing to his credit under the proposed paragraph 70c(1)
_(d), the member of the Fund shall not be treated as an employee under Act_
452 unless he has given to the Board and his employer a notice as may be
prescribed by the Board of his intention to contribute to the Fund. The proposed
subsection 70c(3) seeks to enable the Board to authorize an application by a
member of the Fund who is not a Malaysian citizen to withdraw part of the
amount standing to his credit for the purposes of withdrawal under subsection
54(6) of Act 452 upon any terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the
Board.

21. _Clause 21_ seeks to amend section 70e of Act 452 to provide that

subsection 54(6), section 54a and subsection 55a(2) of Act 452 are now
applicable to a member of the Fund who is not a Malaysian citizen. With
this proposed amendment, a member of the Fund who is not a Malaysian


-----

16 _Bill_

citizen and has not attained the age of fifty-five years may withdraw part of
the amount standing to his credit under subsection 54(6) of Act 452. This
amendment also seeks to require the Board to pay dividend on such amount
withdrawn under subsection 54(6) of Act 452 or credit such dividend on the
amount so withdrawn into the account of the member of the Fund who is not
a Malaysian citizen.

22. _Clause 22_ seeks to introduce a new section 70h into Act 452 to provide

that no dividend shall be credited into the account of a member of the Fund

_Subclause 24(a) seeks to introduce a new paragraph 73(da) into Act 452 to_

the elections by the members of the Fund for their accounts to be managed
according to Shariah under the proposed section 43a and the management of
such accounts.

_Subclause 24(b) seeks to amend paragraph 73(f) of Act 452 to provide for_

dividends.
