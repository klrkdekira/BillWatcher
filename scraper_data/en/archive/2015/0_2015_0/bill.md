-----

_Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)_ 25

to prevent the illegal use of the property.

**Presumption as to illegal property**

**416r. Where any property is seized under this Chapter, the**

so mentioned.

(2) Without prejudice to subsection (1), where any order
has been made, or a decision or judgment given, by any
court in any proceedings under this Chapter, any error or
omission in the order, decision or judgment relating to any

rectified by the court on its own motion or on the application

accused or to await the execution of the warrant,
the Court may, at any time, proceed or continue
with the trial.

(4) If the Court proceeds or continues with the trial pursuant
to subsection (2), the Court may draw an inference adverse
to the accused from the fact that he has absconded.

(5) If an accused reappears at his trial, he is not entitled
to have any part of the proceedings that was conducted in his
absence re-opened unless the Court is satisfied that because
of exceptional circumstances it is in the interest of justice
to re-open the proceedings.

(6) Where an accused has absconded and the Court
proceeds or continues with his trial, counsel for the accused
may continue to act for the accused in the trial.

(7) For the purpose of this section, “judgment” includes

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (“Act 593”) and the
Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2012 (“Act A1431”).

Part I

PRELIMINARY

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

Part II

AMENDMENT TO ACT 593

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 2 of Act 593 by inserting a new
subsection (5) which provides that an offence under the Penal Code is a
seizable offence if it is expressly provided under any other written law that
the offence is a seizable offence.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 13 of Act 593 to allow the public to give_
information to the police about the commission or the intention of any other
person to commit any offence punishable under the Penal Code or under any
written law in a move to curb the rampant rise of crimes.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to amend section 98 of Act 593 by inserting a new
subsection (6) to empower the Public Prosecutor to appear in any application
made under section 98.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend section 117 of Act 593 by inserting a new
subsection (1a) to empower the Public Prosecutor to appear in any remand
application made under section 117.


-----

44 _Bill_

7. _Clause 6_ seeks to amend section 173a of Act 593 by inserting a new
subsection (8) to exclude a person who is charged with a serious offence or
who is charged with the commission of an act of domestic violence from
being discharged either conditionally or unconditionally.

8. _Clause 7_ seeks to introduce new sections 265a, 265b And 265c into
Act 593. The new sections provide for the evidence of a protected witness to be
taken through a special procedure. These amendments are proposed to address
the issue of a witness who is refusing to give testimony in Court because of
the fear that his safety may be compromised if his identity is disclosed.

9. _Clause 8_ seeks to amend section 282 of Act 593 by inserting a new
paragraph _(e)_ which requires the Court to impose a consecutive sentence if
a Person is convicted at one trial for any two or more offences.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 294 of Act 593 by inserting a new_

subsection (6) to exclude an offender who is charged with a serious offence
or who is charged with the commission of an act of domestic violence from
being released on a bond of good behaviour.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to introduce a new section 399b into Act 593. The new_

section 399b provides that any evidence or report given by an expert on the
activities, structure, ritual, ceremonies, hand sign, insignia, characteristic or
any other matters relating to an organized criminal group is to be admitted
as evidence.

12. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend section 402b of Act 593 to provide that

notwithstanding subsection 402b(1) the prosecution shall not be required to obtain
the consent of the accused before tendering any statement in evidence.

13. _Clause 12 seeks to introduce a new section 407b into Act 593. The new_

section 407b requires an accused person to pay a penalty where impounded
property has been disposed of or cannot be traced.

14. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 414 of Act 593. Subclause_ _13(a) seeks_

to amend subsection (1) to empower the Officer in charge of a Police District
to order the sale of seized property which previously was under the purview
of the Chief Police Officer. Subclause 13(b) seeks to amend subsection (2) to
vest the ownership or the proceeds of the sale of an unclaimed seized property
in the Federal Government. Prior to this proposed amendment, the ownership
or the proceeds were vested in the State Government of the State in which
the property was seized.

15. _Clause 14 seeks to substitute section 415 of Act 593 to allow for_

the sale of property detained on the order of a Magistrate made under
subsection 413(3) to be done through a public auction subject to the preconditions specified under paragraphs 415(1)(a), (b), (c) and _(d)._

16. _Clause 15 seeks to introduce a new Chapter XLIa into Act 593 to provide_

for seizure and forfeiture of property and its derivatives belonging to a member
of an organized criminal group which were obtained in the commission of an
offence or which will lead to the commission of an offence. The police officer


-----

_Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)_ 45

may seize movable and immovable property which he reasonably suspects to
be illegal property.

Through this proposed amendment, where any property is seized under this
Chapter, the Court shall presume such property to be illegal property unless
the person whose property was seized proves to the contrary by admissible
evidence and where he adduces any such evidence, the Public Prosecutor shall
have the right to rebut the same.

The right of a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration relating
to the seized and forfeited property is also protected whereby the Court is
compelled to return the property to such person if it is satisfied that the person
has legitimate legal interest over the property, he has no involvement with
the organized criminal group, he has no knowledge of such illegal use of the
property, his acquisition of the property was not for the purpose of avoiding
the eventual subsequent forfeiture of the property, and he has done everything
that is reasonably expected to prevent the illegal use of the property.

17. _Clause 16_ seeks to insert a new section 425a into Act 593. The new

section 425a provides the procedure in instances where an accused absconds
before or during his trial after he has been charged. Under this proposed
amendment, the Court may proceed with the trial and dispose of the case in the
absence of the accused who absconds. The Court may pronounce judgment in
the absence of the accused. However the Court shall not pass any sentences of
death, imprisonment for life, and imprisonment for natural life in the absence
of the accused.

18. _Clause 17 seeks to amend section 430 of Act 593 to empower the_

Minister instead of the Court to reward a private person who has shown unusual
courage, diligence or exertion in the apprehension of a person involved with
a crime. The amendment also increases the reward from a sum not exceeding
one hundred ringgit to a sum of not less than one thousand ringgit and not
more than ten thousand ringgit.

19. _Clause 18 seeks to amend the First Schedule to Act 593 consequential_

to the introduction of new offences into the Penal Code.

Part III

AMENDMENT TO ACT A1431

20. _Clause 19 seeks to substitute section 7 of Act A1431. With this amendment,_

a new subsection (7) is introduced into the proposed section 388a to provide
for a prescribed form to be used in relation to the attachment of the electronic
monitoring device.

21. _Clause 20 seeks to amend section 8 of Act A1431. With this amendment,_

the new section 390a is substituted with a section that includes the use of the
prescribed form for the attachment of the electronic monitoring device and
removes the offence of tampering with or destroying an electronic monitoring
device.


-----

46 _Bill_

22. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor

or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
