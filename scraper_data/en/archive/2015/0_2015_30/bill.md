The proposed amendments seek to provide a new regulatory framework for

clarify the Commission’s powers in relation to closure of a stock exchange
or derivative exchange, to introduce new provisions on netting and protection
of parties’ rights under a qualified capital market agreement, to streamline
and modernize take overs and mergers provisions, to increase the amount of
penalty in respect of breach of administrative action and to provide for other
miscellaneous and consequential matters.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to provide for a general amendment to Act 671 by substituting_
for the words “Securities Commission Act 1993” the words “Securities
Commission Malaysia Act 1993”. This general amendment is consequential
to the amendment made to the Securities Commission Act 1993.

_Capital Markets and Services (Amendment)_ 49

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 671 to introduce new definitions_
and to amend or delete existing definitions used in Act 671.

Commission’s powers in relation to closure of a stock exchange or derivative
exchange. This clause provides that the Commission may recommend the
Minister to close the exchanges if there are emerging risks with regards to the
operations of the exchange and that the Minister may, on the recommendation
of the Commission, direct the exchanges to close their markets.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 30 of Act 671 to enable the Commission_
to publish a suspension order in relation to an exchange, or the notice of
the extension of such suspension order in at least one national language
daily newspaper and one English language daily newspaper for the public’s
information rather than by publishing it in the _Gazette._

9. _Clause 8 seeks to delete Subdivision 3 of Division 2 of Part II of_
Act 671 as it has been moved to the new Subdivision 5a of Division 2 of
Part II in the Act.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to substitute Subdivision 4 of Division 2 of Part II of_
Act 671 to provide for a new regulatory framework for recognized market
replacing the registered electronic facility. This Subdivision provides for the
application of registration of a recognized market operator and the power
of the Commission to withdraw a registration and to review the status of a
recognized market.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to introduce a new Subdivision 5a into Division 2 of_
Part II of Act 671 which contains the provisions previously under the deleted
Subdivision 3 of Division 2 of Part II. This Subdivision seeks to empower
the Commission to transfer control and access of an exchange to a statutory
manager as may be appointed by the Commission, for the purposes of managing
systemic risk, public interest, etc., the power of the statutory managers and
power of the Commission to impose an annual fee or any other fee payable by

house, which include securities borrowing and lending agreements. The new
subdivision provides that any powers exercised by the Commission in relation


-----

50 _Bill_

netting provisions for such contracts. The new subdivision also provides that
no action by any other regulatory authority under any written law, including

power to assume control or managing the business, affairs and properties, may
affect the parties’ rights under a netting provision or the operation of default
proceeding relating to such contracts.

agreement entered into does not have the effect of removing, excluding or
restricting its obligation or liability as the principal of its representative.

14. _Clause 13 seeks to delete section 89 of Act 671 as the prohibition under_

the relevant exam conducted by the Commission and possess the relevant
experience and qualification before they may apply to be licensed.

of a participating organization to purchase securities through another Capital
Market Services License holder under certain circumstances.

17. _Clause 16 seeks to delete section 95 of Act 671 as the requirement under_

Commission’s power to impose any further requirements under section 96 of
Act 671.

218a, 218b, 218c and 218d into Act 671 relating to take-overs and mergers,
to modernize the current provisions, to extend the provision on compulsory

prospectus given to investors for the purpose of offering for subscription or
purchase of securities, as an invitation to subscribe for or purchase securities
or to make available securities that purports to exclude or restrict liability
shall be void.

a trustee-manager shall lodge with the Commission the annual report of the
business trust within four months after the end of each financial year of the
business trust and to remove the requirement for a trustee-manager to lodge
the annual report of the trustee-manager with the Commission within six
months after the end of each financial year of the trustee-manager as the
information contained in an auditor’s report which is required under section 127
of Act 671 is sufficient for the Commission in ensuring the operation of a
trustee-manager.

25. _Clause 32 seeks to amend section 256zp of Act 671 by inserting a new_
subsection (3A) to provide for a due diligence defence to a person who has
breached this section.

relating to debentures was lodged with the Commission.

the matter. The person who is responsible for the distribution of the debentures
is then required to inform the Commission and any person who has been
provided with the information memorandum or disclosure document of the
matter.

28. _Clause 35 seeks to amend section 298 of Act 671 to delete the_
requirement for a management company to lodge the annual report by the
management company within six months after the end of each financial year
of the management company as the information contained in an auditor’s
report which is required under section 127 of Act 671 is sufficient for the
Commission in ensuring the operation of a management company.
