EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

On the eve of Malaysia Day 2011, the Honourable Prime Minister pledged
watershed changes to enhance parliamentary democracy system in Malaysia.
This pledge was reiterated in July 2012 and a decision was made to repeal
the Sedition Act 1948. However, events since that date have demonstrated the
continued relevance of the Sedition Act 1948 in tandem with recognition for
the need for enhanced safeguards against its misuse to stem legitimate criticism
of Government and discussion of issues of concern to Malaysians. Among
the issues of concern are the increasingly harmful and malicious comments,
postings and publications that jeopardize that most valued ideals of Malaysia tolerance and racial and religious harmony in a multiracial, multireligious and
multicultural nation. Even more alarming are calls for the secession of States
in the Federation of Malaysia established by the consensus of the peoples of
Malaysia and unwarranted attacks against the sovereign institutions of Malaysia,
the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the Rulers of the States.

It is against this background that the Government has decided to retain

the Sedition Act 1948 (“Act 15”) at this time with the addition of enhanced
measures and penalties to deal with the threats against peace, public order
and the security of Malaysia, in particular through the irresponsible misuse of
social media platforms and other communication devices to spread divisiveness
and to insult the race, religion, culture, etc. of particular groups of Malaysians
without regard for the consequences.

2. _Clause 1_ of the Bill contains the short title and provision on the
commencement of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 2 of Act 15 to include the_
definition of term “by electronic means”. The term is consequential to the
amendment made to section 10 of Act 15 and the introduction of a new section
10a into Act 15.


-----

10 _Bill_

4. _Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend section 3 of Act 15 and among the_
salient amendments are as follows:

_(a) under_ _subclause_ _(a)(i), it will no longer be an offence under Act 15_

if any person commits an act of bringing into hatred or contempt or
exciting disaffection against the Government. This amendment is in
line with the intention of the Government to be more open whereby
the public is at liberty to give feedback or criticize the Government
so as to create a transparent and accountable administration in
Malaysia;

_(b)_ _subclause_ _(a)(ii) seeks to amend paragraph 3(1)(b) of Act 15 by_

introducing an illustration so as to make clear that paragraph _(b)_
would include the act of exciting any person or any group of persons
to demand for the secession of any State from Malaysia. Such demand
is already seditious under paragraph _(b);_

_(c)_ _subclause (a)(iii) seeks to delete paragraph 3(1)(c) of Act 15 which_

relates to the administration of justice. With this deletion, any act of
bringing into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the
administration of justice in Malaysia will no longer be considered
as seditious and thus will not be dealt with as an offence under
Act 15;

_(d)_ _subclause_ _(a)(v) seeks to introduce a new paragraph_ _(ea) into_

subsection 3(1) of Act 15 to make it an offence for any person to
promote feelings of ill will, hostility or hatred between persons or
groups of persons on the ground of religion. This is in line with
the intention of the Government to protect the sanctity of religions
professed by the multi-religious society in Malaysia. An act of insulting
and ridiculing any religion may cause disharmony and threaten public
order. However, to avoid ambiguity, in relation to the religion of
Islam, religion refers to the _Hukum Syarak as codified under any_
written law and shall not include any deviant teachings; and

_(e) subclause_ _(c) seeks to amend subsection 3(3) of Act 15 so as to expand_

the application of the provision to include indirect publication of
seditious material.

5. _Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 4 of Act 15. The amendment_
to subsection 4(1) seeks to substitute the current penalty for offences under
subsection 4(1) with a minimum penalty of three years imprisonment and a
maximum penalty of seven years and to do away with the penalty of fine.
In addition to the increase in penalty under subsection 4(1), this _clause also_
seeks to insert the new subsection 4(1a) to provide for even a higher penalty
for offences under the Act if bodily injury or damage to property occurs as a
result of the commission of the offence. In such cases, a minimum penalty of
five years imprisonment and a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment
will be imposed in consideration of the seriousness of the offence.


-----

_Sedition (Amendment)_ 11

6. _Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to introduce new sections 5a and 5b into_

Act 15. The new section 5a provides that where a person is charged with
an offence under subsection 4(1a) and there is a certificate in writing by
the Public Prosecutor stating that it is not in the public interest to grant bail
to the person charged, the person shall not be released on bail. The new
section 5a is in line with the proposal to impose a higher penalty for sedition
offences involving bodily injury and damage to property. The new section
5b seeks to empower the court to prevent a person who is charged under
section 4 who is released on bail from leaving Malaysia. This includes ordering
the person charged to surrender his travel documents. In cases where the person
does not own any travel document, the court may order the Director General
of Immigration to refuse the issuance of any travel document to the person.

7. _Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to amend section 6 of Act 15. With this_

amendment, the court shall apply the ordinary rules of evidence as regards
the credibility of a witness in sedition cases.

8. _Clause 7_ of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 6a into Act 15.

The new section 6a specifies that sections 173a, 293 and 294 of the Criminal
Procedure Code shall not apply in respect of offences under subsection 4(1a)
of Act 15.

9. _Clause 8 of the Bill seeks to amend section 10 of Act 15 to empower_

the Court to issue an order for the removal of seditious publication which is
made by electronic means, such as online publication.

10. _Clause 9 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 10a into Act 15._

Under this new section, the court is empowered to issue an order regarding
seditious publication made by electronic means by a person who cannot be
identified. For this purpose, since the perpetrator cannot be identified, the
order shall be directed to an authorized officer under the Communications
and Multimedia Act 1998 to prevent access to such publication.

11. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor

or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
