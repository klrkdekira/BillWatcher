security that the suspension should be revoked,

former place of detention or, if the Board so directs, sent to
another place of detention.

commencing immediately upon the expiration of its then current
duration.

(2) Where the Board directs for the duration of a detention
order, restriction order or suspended detention order to be extended
under subsection (1), it shall set out in the direction the grounds
for the extension and state whether such grounds are—

_(a) the same as the grounds on which the order was originally_

made;

_(b) different from the grounds on which the order was_

originally made; or

_(c) partly the same grounds and partly different grounds._

(3) Where the duration of a suspended detention order is
extended under subsection (1), the duration of the direction for its
suspension under subsection 15(1) shall be deemed to be extended
for the duration of the extension of the suspended detention
order together with the restrictions and conditions imposed in


-----

18 _Bill_

respect of such suspension, subject, if the Board so directs, to
the requirement that the person against whom the detention order

in the same manner as it applies to an original suspension under
subsection 15(1).

(4) Where the direction under subsection (1) for the extension
of the duration of a detention order or a suspended detention
order is on grounds which fall under paragraph (2)(b) or _(c),_

subsection 17(1) for the extension of the duration of any such
order, if it deems it just or fit to do so.

(2) Any revocation under subsection (1) shall be without

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

On 24 September 2014, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution
2178 (“SCR 2178”) to address the threats to international peace and security
caused by terrorist acts. SCR 2178 calls upon all Member States, in accordance
with their obligations under international law, to cooperate in efforts to address
the threat posed by persons engaging in the commission or support of terrorist
acts in a foreign country or any part of a foreign country, including by preventing
recruitment and travel of such persons, disrupting and preventing financial
support to terrorist groups and developing and implementing prosecution,
rehabilitation and reintegration strategies for such persons upon their return
to Malaysia.

2. In recognition of the continuing threat of terrorism within and outside
Malaysia, on 26 November 2014, the Honourable Prime Minister tabled the
White Paper entitled “Ke Arah Menangani Ancaman Kumpulan Islamic State”
in Parliament. The White Paper reaffirmed the Government’s commitment
in combating the threats posed by the Islamic State (IS) along with the rest
of the international community and provided for the proposed measures to
deal with those threats. Paragraph 41 of the White Paper also recognized the
Resolutions passed by the United Nations Security Council.

3. Based on the recommendation in paragraph 59 of the White Paper, a new
law is to be enacted to specifically address the IS threats. In addition, other
laws such as the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 [Act 747],
the Prevention of Crime Act 1959 [Act 297] and the Penal Code [Act 574]
are to be further strengthened.

4. Pursuant to the White Paper, this Bill seeks to provide for the prevention
of the commission or support of terrorist acts involving listed terrorist
organizations in a foreign country or any part of a foreign country and for
the control of persons engaged in such acts and for related matters.

Part I

5. This Part deals with preliminary matters.


-----

_Prevention of Terrorism_ 29

_Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of

the Act while _clause 2 contains definitions of certain words and expressions_
used in the Act. Among the salient terms defined are “terrorist act” and “listed
terrorist organization” where “terrorist act” has the same meaning assigned to
it by the Penal Code and “listed terrorist organization” means any specified
entity declared under sections 66b and 66c of the Anti-Money Laundering,
Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001.

Part II

6. Part II contains powers of arrest, and deals with the steps preceding the
holding of an inquiry under Part III.

By _clause 3, a police officer may without a warrant arrest any person if_

he has reason to believe that grounds exist which would justify the holding
of an inquiry into the case of that person. This power is coupled with the
power of investigation contained in _clause 29 under which a police officer_
not below the rank of Inspector is empowered to make an investigation into
the facts and circumstances of any case in which he has reason to believe that
grounds exist which would justify the holding of an inquiry under Part III.
When a person is arrested under _subclause 3(1), the case shall be referred by_
the police officer to the Public Prosecutor for direction not later than seven
days from the date of arrest.

Any person arrested must be produced before a Magistrate who, on

production of a written statement signed by a police officer not below the rank
of Inspector stating that it is intended to hold an inquiry into the case of such
person, must either order his detention in custody for a period of twenty-one
days, or, if no such statement is produced, direct his release (clause 4).

Any person so detained must, unless sooner released, on or before the expiry

of the period of twenty-one days be produced before a Magistrate. Where there
is a statement from the Public Prosecutor stating that in his opinion sufficient
evidence exists to justify the holding of an inquiry under _clause 10 and a_
statement from a police officer not below the rank of Assistant Superintendent
stating that it is proposed to hold such an inquiry, the Magistrate must order
the remand of such person in custody for a further period of thirty-eight days.
In any other case, the Magistrate must direct his release.

Notwithstanding the special powers of arrest and detention under clause 4,

an important element under this clause that must be emphasized is that no
person shall be arrested under this clause solely for his political belief or
political activity (subclause 4(3)).

Under _clause 5, every person remanded in custody under_ _clause_ _4 shall,_

if not sooner released, as soon as possible be brought before an Inquiry
Officer.

_Clause 6 provides that any person remanded in custody under clause 4 may_

at any time be taken before a Sessions Court Judge who, if there are no other
grounds on which the person is lawfully detained, shall direct his release if


-----

30 _Bill_

there is produced to him a statement in writing signed by a police officer not
below the rank of Assistant Superintendent stating that it is not intended to
continue with an inquiry into the case of that person under _clause 10. In any_
other case, on the application of a police officer, the Sessions Court Judge
may direct for the person to be released subject to the execution of bond for
his due appearance at such place and at such time and within such period not
exceeding fifty-nine days or be released subject to the supervision of the police
for such period not exceeding fifty-nine days. Where the person is released
subject to a bond or supervision of the police, an electronic monitoring device
shall be attached to the person.

_Clause 7 prescribes the procedures relating to the attachment of the electronic_

monitoring device on a remanded person upon his release under _clause 6._

Part III

7. Part III deals with inquiries.

_Clause 8_ establishes the Prevention of Terrorism Board and provides for

its powers.

_Clause 9_ empowers the Minister to appoint Inquiry Officers. No police

officer may be appointed as an Inquiry Officer.

_Clause 10_ sets out the duties and powers of Inquiry Officers. An Inquiry

Officer shall inquire and report in writing to the Board whether there are
reasonable grounds for believing that a person is engaged in the commission
or support of terrorist acts involving listed terrorist organizations in a foreign
country or any part of a foreign country. For the purpose of any inquiry, the
Inquiry Officer may procure and receive all evidence, summon and examine
witnesses, require the production of any document or other thing in his
opinion relevant to the inquiry, receive evidence in the absence of the person
who is the subject of the inquiry if it is necessary in the public interest or to
protect a witness or his family or associates, and give any direction as may
be necessary.

A person summoned as a witness who fails to attend at the time and

place mentioned in the summons or who refuses to answer any question that
may lawfully be put to him or to produce any document or thing which is
in his power to produce, commits an offence and shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding
two thousand ringgit or to both. A person who is the subject of an inquiry or
a witness at an inquiry shall not be represented by an advocate and solicitor
at the inquiry except when his own evidence is being taken and recorded by
the Inquiry Officer.

_Clause 11 provides for the access of the Inquiry Officer to persons detained_

under any other written law or confined in prison.

_Clause 12 prescribes the requirement for the reporting by the Inquiry_

Officer to the Board. Where the Board concurs with the Inquiry Officer
that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person who was the
subject of the inquiry is engaged in the commission or support of terrorist acts


-----

_Prevention of Terrorism_ 31

involving listed terrorist organizations in a foreign country or any part of a
foreign country, the Board shall proceed under clause 13. Where there are no
reasonable grounds for such belief, the Board shall forthwith direct any person
having the custody of that person to produce the person within twenty-four
hours before a Sessions Court Judge who shall thereupon discharge the order
of remand made under _clause 4. Further, if there are no other grounds on_
which the person is lawfully detained, the Sessions Court Judge shall order
his immediate release.

Part IV

8. Part IV provides for detention and restriction orders.

_Clause 13_

_Clause 13 empowers the Board to order the detention or restriction of any_

person who is engaged in the commission or support of terrorist acts involving
listed terrorist organizations in a foreign country or any part of a foreign
country after considering the complete report of an investigation submitted
under _subclause 3(4) and the report of the Inquiry Officer submitted under_
_clause 12._ _Subclause (1) provides that detention orders may be issued by the_
Board directing that such person be detained for a period not exceeding two
years if it is considered necessary in the interest of the security of Malaysia
or any part of Malaysia. A detention order may be renewed under _clause 17_
for further periods not exceeding two years at a time.

_Subclause (3) empowers the Board to issue restriction orders where it_

is necessary to control and supervise a person in respect of his activities,
freedom of movement or places of residence or employment but there is no
necessity to detain the person. A restriction order shall direct that such person
be subject to the supervision of the police for any period not exceeding five
years at a time and may be subject to such restrictions and conditions as may
be necessary. A restriction order may be renewed under _clause 17 for further_
periods not exceeding five years at a time.

_Subclauses (5)_ and (6) make it an offence for any restricted person to fail

to comply with any restriction or condition imposed on him and for any other
person to conspire with, abet or assist the restricted person to breach such
restriction or condition. Offences under these _subclauses_ shall be punished
with imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years and not less than two
years. Sections 173a and 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code shall not apply
in respect of these offences.

_Subclause (9) is included for the avoidance of doubt as to the application_

of Article 151 of the Federal Constitution. Since this Act is enacted under
Article 149 of the Federal Constitution and provides for preventive detention,
the safeguard under Article 151(1) automatically applies and requires that
any person detained under this Act shall be given the opportunity of making
representations against the detention order as soon as may be to an advisory
board constituted under Article 151(2). The procedures for making such
representation will be provided in regulations made under this Act.


-----

32 _Bill_

_Clauses 14 to 18_

_Clause 14 affirms the validity of detention orders in the event of administrative_

shortcomings in service on the person to be detained while clause 15 provides
for the suspension of detention orders.

_Clause 16_ provides that the term of detention shall be deemed to be

undergone concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed under any
written law.

_Clause 18 empowers the Board to revoke any detention order, restriction_

order, suspended detention order or direction for extension of any such order
if the Board deems it just or fit to do so.

_Clause 19_

_Clause 19_ seeks to oust judicial review of any act or decision of the

Prevention of Terrorism Board regarding any question except on compliance
with any procedural requirement in this Act.

_Clauses 20 and 21_

The Board is empowered under _clause 20 to order the removal of any_

person detained from one place of detention to another, while subclause 21(1)
empowers the Commissioner General of Prison or the Inspector General of
Police, as the case may be, to order the production of a detained person at
any place in the interest of justice, or for the purpose of any public or other
inquiry, or in the national interest, or in the interests of the person detained,
in custody or confined.

_Clauses 22 and 23_

_Subclause 22(1) provides for the name of every restricted person and every_

person in respect of whom a detention order is in force to be entered in a
Register to be kept by the Registrar of Criminals appointed under section
3 of the Registration of Criminals and Undesirable Persons Act 1969 while
_subclause 23(1)_ provides that such name shall be removed from the Register
where the detention order or restriction order expires or is revoked. The Board
may, at any time in its discretion, direct the Registrar to remove the name of
any person from the Register.

_Clauses 24 to 28_

_Clause 24_ makes it an offence for any registered person to consort or

habitually associate with any other registered person without the permission of
the Officer in Charge of the Police District in which he resides, unless he did
not know and had no reason to suspect that such other person was a registered
person. An offence under this clause shall be punished with imprisonment for
a term not exceeding fifteen years and not less than five years.

_Clause 25 imposes double penalties and also whipping for any registered_

person who is convicted of any offence committed under any written law after
the date of the entry of his name in the Register.


-----

_Prevention of Terrorism_ 33

_Clause 26 makes it an offence for any registered person who is unable to_

give a satisfactory explanation therefor to be found in the company of two or
more registered persons, or in or near any place in which any act of violence
or breach of the peace is being or has just been committed or frequenting or
loitering in or about any public place or place of public entertainment. An
offence under this _clause_ shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not
exceeding five years or to a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit or to
both.

_Clause 27 makes it an offence to harbour any registered person contravening_

any order under _clause 13_ provided that this _clause shall not apply to the_
case of a wife harbouring or concealing her husband or a husband harbouring
or concealing his wife. An offence under this _clause shall be punished with_
imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to a fine not exceeding
ten thousand ringgit or to both.

_Clause 28 provides that the detention of any person under Part IV shall be_

without prejudice to the taking of any criminal proceeding against that person,
whether during or after the period of his detention.

Part V

9. Part V contains certain general provisions.

_Clause 30 empowers a police officer to arrest without warrant any person_

committing an offence under _clauses 24, 26 or_ _27._

_Clause 31 empowers the taking of photographs and finger impressions of_

any person arrested under _subclause 3(1), or whose name is required to be_

date of coming into operation of this Act and such person shall continue to
be subject to the supervision order or detention order, as the case may be,
for so long as the supervision order or detention order is in force.


-----
