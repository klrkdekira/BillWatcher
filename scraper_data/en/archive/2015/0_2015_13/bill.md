Act 2013 [Act 758] and the Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 [Act 759]
which repealed a few Acts including the Banking and Financial Institutions
Act 1989 [Act 372], the Insurance Act 1996 [Act 553], the Islamic Banking
Act 1983 [Act 276] and the Takaful Act 1984 [Act 312], to introduce share
transfer powers in relation to non-viable member institutions, and to provide
for other consequential or incidental matters.

2. Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to provide for a general amendment to delete the word_
“solidarity” in relation to “family solidarity takaful” under Act 720 to reflect

and to amend certain existing definitions in Act 720.

of membership to be extended to “persons” and not limited to “corporations”.

10. _Clause 10 seeks to amend paragraphs 28(1)(c), (d),_ _(e) and (f) of Act 720_

to reflect that the amount received by the Corporation from insurer members
in respect of the Takaful and Insurance Benefits Protection System is referred
to as “levies”.


-----
