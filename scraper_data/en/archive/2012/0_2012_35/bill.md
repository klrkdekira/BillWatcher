EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Bill seeks to amend the Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 (“Act 4”).
The primary purpose of the Bill is to increase the eligibility of insured persons
for invalidity pension and the eligibility of the dependant of the insured persons
for survivors’ pension by increasing the eligible age limit of the insured person
from fifty-five years of age to sixty years of age.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the power of the Minister_
to appoint the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend the definition of “employee” for the purpose of_
clarity.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 3 consequential upon the proposed_
amendments made to the definition of “employee” under _clause 2. Via this_
amendment, the Minister is empowered to amend the First Schedule to prescribe
for persons not included in the definition of “employee”, by order published
in the _Gazette._

5. _Clauses 4, 5, 6, 8, 10_ and 11 seek to amend sections 15, 17, 20A, 21, 29
and 57A of Act 4 as well as the First Schedule and Eighth Schedule to Act 4
to increase the eligible age limit of the insured person from fifty-five years
of age to sixty years of age for the purpose of increasing the eligibility for
invalidity pension and survivors’ pension. These amendments are essential to
realize the primary purpose of the proposed Act.

6. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 30 of Act 4 to provide flexibility to the_
Minister in prescribing the rate for constant-attendance allowance. However,
the rate of constant-attendance allowance to be prescribed under this section
as amended by the proposed Act shall not cause a less favourable situation to
insured persons who have been entitled to the constant-attendance allowance
at the rate equivalent to forty per cent of the rate of such pension or benefit
or at any higher rate as prescribed by the Minister pursuant to this section
before the coming into operation of the amendment of this section.

7. _Clause 9_ seeks to introduce new section 112A into Act 4 relating to
electronic submission of documents. The new section 112A provides that the
Organization may allow any returns, statements, particulars, records, notice,
reports, register or other documents required to be submitted or furnished
under this Act or regulations made under this Act by an electronic medium
or by way of an electronic transmission and, such submission shall be subject
to the conditions and specifications determined by the Organization. The
acknowledgment of receipt by the Organization, returns, statements, particulars,
records, notice, reports, register or other documents submitted or furnished
pursuant to this section shall be admissible as evidence in any proceedings.

8. _Clause 12 provides for the effect of increasing the eligible age limit of_
insured person from fifty-five years to sixty years. This is to facilitate a better
understanding on the application of the proposed amendment to the eligible
age limit of insured person in relation to invalidity pension and the survivors’
pension.
