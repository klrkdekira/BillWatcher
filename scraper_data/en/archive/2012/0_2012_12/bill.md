EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The proposed Territorial Sea Act 2012 (“the proposed Act”) seeks to provide
for the territorial sea of Malaysia to replace the Emergency (Essential Powers)
Ordinance, No. 7 1969 [P.U. (A) 307a/1969]. The Emergency (Essential Powers)
Ordinance, No. 7 1969 was made under the Proclamation of Emergency of 1969.
The Government has decided to annul all the three Proclamations of Emergency.
The three Proclamations of Emergency are the Proclamation of Emergency
of 1966, the Proclamation of Emergency of 1969 and the Proclamation of
Emergency of 1979. With the annulment, all the Emergency Ordinances and
Acts made under the three Proclamations of Emergency will cease to have
effect. On 24 November 2011, the Dewan Rakyat passed a resolution that the
three Proclamations of Emergency be annulled and on 20 December 2011, the
Senate passed a resolution to annul the same. As a consequence, the proposed
Act is now necessary to preserve the territorial integrity of Malaysia.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title, date of commencement and application_
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ contains the definition of certain words used in the proposed
Act.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to provide for the limit of the territorial sea for Malaysia_
based on the principle of international law and the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea 1982.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to provide for the sovereignty of the territorial sea to_
be vested in and exercisable by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in right of the
Federation consistent with international law and the Federal Constitution.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to provide for the maps and charts of limits of territorial_
sea.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to provide for the references to “territorial waters” in any_
other written law, arrangement and instruments in so far as it affects federal
law to mean “territorial sea” as construed under the proposed Act. “Territorial
sea” is the new term used in replacement of “territorial waters” in other written
laws. The term “territorial sea” is consistent with the term used in the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982.

8. _Clause 7 contains the power of the Prime Minister to make regulations._

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.

[PN(U[2])2851]
