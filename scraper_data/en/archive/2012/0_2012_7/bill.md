EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971
(“Act 30”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provisions on the commencement
of the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 30 to introduce the new definition
of “Director General” and to amend the definition of “Campus”. The definition
of “Director General” is introduced consequent upon the creation of the post
of the Director General of Higher Education who is appointed by the Minister
under the new subsection 4c(1). The amendment to the definition of “Campus”
seeks to extend the definition to include the Campus as specified in the order
made under subsection 6(1) of Act 30 and also the area, together with all
buildings or other structures thereon, which belongs to or is used, whether
permanently or otherwise, by a University or University College.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to introduce a new Part IIa into Act 30 relating to
administration. The proposed section 4c deals with the appointment of the
Director General of Higher Education and the Deputy Director General. The
proposed section 4d provides for the delegation of the Minister’s functions,
powers and duties to the Director General.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to substitute subsection 5a(2) of Act 30 to enable the Yang_
di-Pertuan Agong, on the advice of the Minister, to authorize the establishment
of a higher educational institution having the status of a University in the
national interest.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to substitute for section 15 of Act 30 a new section 15.

The proposed subsection 15(1) seeks to extend the students’ right of

association to include the right to become a member of any political party.
The existing section 15 of Act 30 does not allow students to become members
of political parties.

The proposed paragraphs 15(2)(a) and _(b) provide for restrictions on_

students in respect of becoming members of an unlawful society, _etc., and_
members of a society, _etc., which the Board determines to be unsuitable to_
the interests and well-being of the students or the University. However, the
determination by the Board under the proposed paragraph 15(2)(b) shall not
include a political party.

The proposed paragraph 15(2)(c) seeks to prohibit a student from running

for election to or holding any post in any society, organization, body or
group of students in the Campus if he holds any post in a political party. The
prohibition seeks to maintain neutrality in the Campus.

The proposed paragraph 15(2)(d) seeks to impose restrictions on students’

involvement in political party activities inside the Campus. This restriction
seeks to maintain neutrality in the Campus. However, no restriction is imposed
on students’ political party activities outside the Campus.


-----

_Universities and University Colleges (Amendment)_ 11

The proposed subsection 15(3) seeks to remove the restrictions imposed on

students and societies, organizations, bodies or groups of students in expressing
or doing anything which may reasonably be construed as expressing support
for or sympathy with or opposition to any political party. This is consistent
with the Court of Appeal’s decision in the case of _Muhammad Hilman_
_Idham & Ors v Kerajaan Malaysia & Ors [2011] 9 CLJ 50. However, the_
subsection maintains the restrictions in the existing subsection 15(5) of Act
30 whereby the students and societies, organizations, bodies or groups of
students are not allowed to express or do anything which may reasonably be
construed as expressing support for or sympathy with or opposition to any
unlawful society, organization, etc., and any society, organization, etc., which
the Board determines to be unsuitable to the interests and well-being of the
students or the University.

The proposed subsection 15(4) provides the exceptions to the restrictions

imposed in the proposed subsection 15(3) as provided under the existing
section 15 of Act 30.

The proposed subsection 15(5) seeks to impose an obligation on the University

to regulate the activities of students or students’ society, organization, body
or group inside the Campus.

7. _Subclause 6(a)_ seeks to delete subsection 16b(9) of Act 30 to disallow a
student who has submitted an appeal before the Student Disciplinary Appeal
Committee under subsection 16b(5) of Act 30 to be represented by an employee
or another student of the University. This is because the student has been
given the right to be represented by an employee or another student of the
University under subsection 16b(3b) of Act 30 and the student has also been
given the right to make a written representation before the Student Disciplinary
Appeal Committee under subsection 16b(10) of Act 30. _Subclause 6(b)_ seeks
to amend subsection 16b(11) of Act 30 to extend the period from thirty days
to sixty days during which the Student Disciplinary Appeal Committee is
required to decide on an appeal.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new Part IVa into Act 30. The proposed_
section 22a requires the Director General to keep and maintain or cause to
be kept or maintained the National Higher Education Register. The proposed
section 22b imposes an obligation on a higher educational institution established
under section 6 of Act 30 to keep and maintain a database which shall be
made accessible to the Minister.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section 24e_ into Act 30 to empower
the Minister to make regulations for the purposes of Act 30.

10. _Clause 9_ seeks to amend the Constitution of the University in the First

Schedule to Act 30.

_Paragraph 9(a)(i)_ seeks to amend subsection 10(3) to state that the

conditions of appointment of the Registrar, the Bursar, the Chief Librarian
and the Legal Adviser shall be determined by the Board. _Paragraph 9(a)(ii)_
seeks to insert new subsections 10(4), (5) and (6) into the Constitution. The
proposed subsection 10(4) states that the term of office for the Registrar, the


-----

12 _Bill_

Bursar and the Legal Adviser shall not be more than three years and they
are eligible for reappointment. The proposed subsection 10(5) states that the
Chief Librarian shall hold office for a period as determined by the Board.
The proposed subsection 10(6) states that the appointments of the Registrar,
the Bursar, the Chief Librarian and the Legal Adviser are revocable by the
Board.

_Subclause 9(b)_ seeks to delete section 20a of the Constitution relating to
the Employee Welfare Committee.

_Subclause 9(c) seeks to introduce a new section 21a in the Constitution to_

establish the Students’ Complaints Committee which shall have the power to
conduct investigations or inquiries into any complaint made by a student in
the manner as may be prescribed by Statute.

11. _Clause 10_ seeks to amend subsubsubparagraph 1(a)(iv) of the Second
Schedule to Act 30 to make the national language text and the English language
text consistent.

12. _Clause 11 seeks to provide for savings provision._

13. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are

amendments which are minor or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
