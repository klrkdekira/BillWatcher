EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Educational Institutions (Discipline) Act 1976
(“Act 174”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 174 to delete the definition of_
“Campus”.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to substitute for section 10 of Act 174 a new section 10.

The proposed subsection 10(1) seeks to extend the students’ right of

association to include the right to become a member of any political party. The
existing section 10 of Act 174 does not allow students to become members
of political parties.


-----

4 _Bill_

The proposed paragraphs 10(2)(a) and (b) provide for restrictions on students

in respect of becoming members of an unlawful society, etc., and members of
a society, etc., which the Minister, after consultation with the Executive Head,
determines and specifies in writing to the Executive Head to be unsuitable to
the interests and well-being of the students or the Institution. However, the
determination by the Minister under the proposed paragraph 10(2)(b) shall not
include a political party.

The proposed paragraph 10(2)(c) seeks to prohibit a student from running

for election to or holding any post in any society, organization, body or
group of students in the campus if he holds any post in a political party. The
prohibition seeks to maintain the neutrality in the campus.

The proposed paragraph 10(2)(d) seeks to impose restriction on students’

involvement in political party activities inside the campus. This restriction
seeks to maintain the neutrality in the campus. However, no restriction is
imposed on students’ political party activities outside the campus.

The proposed subsection 10(3) seeks to remove the restriction imposed on

students and societies, organizations, bodies or groups of students in expressing
or doing anything which may reasonably be construed as expressing support
for or sympathy with or opposition to any political party. This is consistent
with the Court of Appeal’s decision in the case of _Muhammad Hilman Idham_
_& Ors v Kerajaan Malaysia & Ors [2011] 9 CLJ 50. However, the subsection_
maintains the restrictions in the existing subsection 10(5) of Act 174 whereby
the students and societies, organizations, bodies or groups of students are
not allowed to express or do anything which may reasonably be construed as
expressing support for or sympathy with or opposition to any unlawful society,
organization, _etc., and any society, organization,_ _etc., which the Minister_
determines to be unsuitable to the interests and well-being of the students or
the Institution.

The proposed subsection 10(4) provides the exceptions to the restrictions

imposed in the proposed subsection 10(3) as provided under the existing
section 10 of Act 174.

The proposed subsection 10(5) seeks to impose an obligation on the Institution

to regulate the activities of students or students’ society, organization, body
or group inside the campus.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to provide for savings provision.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
