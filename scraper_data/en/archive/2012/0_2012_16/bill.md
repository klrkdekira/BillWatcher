EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (“Act 593”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint_
the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 2 of Act 593 to introduce the_
definitions of “communication” and “communications service provider” which
will be relevant for the interpretation of the proposed new section 116C.

4. _Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to introduce three new sections, namely sections_
116A, 116B and 116C, into Act 593 to enhance the investigative powers of the
police.

The proposed new section 116A seeks to enable a police officer not below
the rank of Inspector to exercise the power of search and seizure without
warrant, whilst sections 116B and 116C seek to allow a police officer to have
access to computerized data and to intercept communication respectively.

5. _Clause 6_ seeks to amend section 127A of Act 593 consequent to the
introduction of a new Chapter VIB in the Penal Code.

6. _Clause 7_ seeks to amend section 153 of Act 593 to provide that when
the accused is charged with an offence relating to publication by electronic
means, the place of publication is where the publication is seen, heard or read
by any person.

7. Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section, namely section 388A, into Act
593 to enable the Court to impose an electronic monitoring requirement upon
an accused person in lieu of payment of a bond where the accused person is

8. _Clause 9_ seeks to introduce three new sections, namely sections 390A,

requirement.

Section 390A requires the Court to explain the consequences which may
follow any failure by a person to comply with the electronic monitoring
requirement and any conditions that may be attached. Non-compliance with
any conditions of the electronic monitoring requirement will result in the bail
being revoked. A person commits an offence if he tampers with or destroys
the electronic monitoring device. Section 390B requires the person who will be
attached with the electronic monitoring device to cooperate with the specified
arrangement which has been made. Section 390C sets out the type of electronic
monitoring devices which may be used.

9. _Clause 10_ seeks to introduce a new section, namely section 445, into
Act 593 to deal with the application of an electronic monitoring device on a
convicted or acquitted person after his trial pending an appeal.

10. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.
