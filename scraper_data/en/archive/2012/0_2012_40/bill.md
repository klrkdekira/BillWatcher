vary the sum covered by, and the surplus or profit allotted to, the family
takaful certificate so that, as varied, they bear the same proportion to the sum
covered by, and the surplus or profit allotted to, the family takaful certificate
before variation as the amount of the takaful contribution that has been paid

(3) Where the true age as shown by the proof is less than that on which

the family takaful certificate is based, the licensed family takaful operator

covered.

operator from calling for proof of age at any time and no family takaful
certificate shall be deemed to be disputed merely because the terms of the

**Interpretation**

2. In this Schedule—

“consumer” means the individual who enters into, varies or renews a consumer

takaful contract, or proposes to do so with a licensed takaful operator;

“consumer takaful contract” means a contract of takaful entered into, varied

or renewed by an individual wholly for purposes unrelated to the individual’s
trade, business or profession.

**Contracting out**

3. (1) A term of a consumer takaful contract, or of any other contract, is
rendered void to the extent that it would put the consumer in a worse position
in respect of the matters mentioned in subparagraph (2) than he would be in
by virtue of the provisions of this Schedule.

(2) The matters referred to in subparagraph (1) are—

_(a) disclosure and representations by the consumer to the licensed takaful_

operator before the contract is entered into, varied or renewed;
and

_(b) the non-contestability of contracts of family takaful and any of the_

remedies for consumer takaful contracts provided in Part 3 of this
Schedule.

(3) This paragraph does not apply in relation to a contract for the settlement

of a claim arising under a consumer takaful contract.

Part 2

Pre-contractual disclosure and representations

**Pre-contractual duty of disclosure for takaful contracts other than consumer**
**takaful contracts**

4. (1) Before a contract of takaful other than a consumer takaful contract
is entered into, varied or renewed, a proposer shall disclose to the licensed
takaful operator a matter that—

_(a)_ he knows to be relevant to the decision of the licensed takaful operator

on whether to accept the risk or not and the rates and terms to be
applied; or

_(b)_ a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know

to be relevant.

(2) The duty of disclosure shall not require the disclosure of a matter

that—

_(a)_ diminishes the risk to the licensed takaful operator;


-----

250 _Bill_

_(b) is of common knowledge;_

_(c)_ the licensed takaful operator knows or in the ordinary course of his

business ought to know; or

_(d)_ in respect of which the licensed takaful operator has waived any

requirement for disclosure.

(3) Where a proposer fails to answer or gives an incomplete or irrelevant

answer to a question contained in the proposal form or asked by the licensed
takaful operator and the matter was not pursued further by the licensed
takaful operator, compliance with the proposer’s duty of disclosure in respect
of the matter shall be deemed to have been waived by the licensed takaful
operator.

(4) A licensed takaful operator shall, before a contract of takaful is entered

into, varied or renewed, clearly inform a proposer in writing of the proposer’s
pre-contractual duty of disclosure under this paragraph, and that this duty of
disclosure shall continue until the time the contract is entered into, varied or
renewed.

**Pre-contractual duty of disclosure for consumer takaful contracts**

5. (1) Before a consumer takaful contract is entered into or varied, a licensed
takaful operator may request a proposer who is a consumer to answer any
specific questions that are relevant to the decision of the licensed takaful
operator whether to accept the risk or not and the rates and terms to be
applied.

(2) It is the duty of the consumer to take reasonable care not to make a

misrepresentation to the licensed takaful operator when answering any questions
under subparagraph (1).

(3) Before a consumer takaful contract is renewed, a licensed takaful

operator may either—

_(a) request a consumer to answer one or more specific questions in_

accordance with subparagraph (1); or

_(b) give the consumer a copy of any matter previously disclosed by the_

consumer in relation to the contract and request the consumer to
confirm or amend any change to that matter.

(4) It is the duty of the consumer to take reasonable care not to make a

misrepresentation to the licensed takaful operator when answering any questions
under subsubparagraph (3)(a), or confirming or amending any matter under
subsubparagraph (3)(b).

(5) If the licensed takaful operator does not make a request in accordance

with subparagraph (1) or (3) as the case may be, compliance with the consumer’s
duty of disclosure in respect of those subparagraphs, shall be deemed to have
been waived by the licensed takaful operator.


-----

_Islamic Financial Services_ 251

(6) Where the consumer fails to answer or gives an incomplete or irrelevant

answer to any request by the licensed takaful operator under subparagraph (1)
or subsubparagraph (3)(a), or fails to confirm or amend any matter under
subsubparagraph (3)(b), or does so incompletely or provides irrelevant
information, as the case may be, and the answer or matter was not pursued
further by the licensed takaful operator, compliance with the consumer’s duty
of disclosure in respect of the answer or matter shall be deemed to have been
waived by the licensed takaful operator.

(7) A licensed takaful operator shall, before a consumer takaful contract

is entered into, varied or renewed, clearly inform the consumer in writing of
the consumer’s pre-contractual duty of disclosure under this paragraph, and
that this duty of disclosure shall continue until the time the contract is entered
into, varied or renewed.

(8) Subject to subparagraphs (1) and (3), a consumer shall take reasonable

care to disclose to the licensed takaful operator any matter, other than that
in relation to subparagraph (1) or (3), that he knows to be relevant to the
decision of the licensed takaful operator on whether to accept the risk or not
and the rates and terms to be applied.

(9) Nothing in this Schedule shall affect the duty of utmost good faith to

be exercised by a consumer and licensed takaful operator in their dealings
with each other, including the making and paying of a claim, after a contract
of takaful has been entered into, varied or renewed.

**Duty to take reasonable care**

6. (1) In determining whether a consumer has taken reasonable care not
to make a misrepresentation under subparagraph 5(2) or (4), the relevant
circumstances may be taken into account including—

_(a) the consumer takaful contract in question and the manner in which_

the contract was marketed to the consumer;

_(b) any relevant explanatory material or publicity produced or authorized_

by the licensed takaful operator; and

_(c) how clear and specific, the licensed takaful operator’s questions_

were.

(2) Subject to subparagraph (3), the standard of care required of the consumer

under subparagraphs 5(2) and (4) shall be what a reasonable consumer in the
circumstances would have known.

(3) If the licensed takaful operator was, or ought to have been, aware of any

particular characteristics or circumstances of the consumer, the licensed takaful
operator shall take into account such characteristics or circumstances.


-----

252 _Bill_

**Misrepresentation in respect of takaful contracts**

7. (1) Part 3 of this Schedule—

_(a) in Division 1, makes provision for a misrepresentation made in relation_

to a contract of family takaful, whether or not a consumer takaful
contract, which has been effected for a period of more than two
years; and

_(b) in Division 2, sets out the remedies available to a licensed takaful_

operator for a misrepresentation made in respect of—

(i) a consumer takaful contract of family takaful which has been

effected for a period of two years or less; and

(ii) a consumer takaful contract of general takaful.

(2) The remedies set out in Division 2 shall be available to a licensed

takaful operator for misrepresentation made by a consumer before a consumer
takaful contract referred to in subsubparagraph (1)(b) was entered into, varied
or renewed if—

_(a)_ the consumer has made a misrepresentation in breach of his duty under

subparagraph 5(2) or (4); and

_(b)_ the licensed takaful operator shows that had it known the true facts, it

would not have entered into the contract, or agreed to the variation
or renewal, or would only have done so on different terms.

(3) For the purposes of this Schedule, a misrepresentation for which a

licensed takaful operator has a remedy in Division 2 against a consumer may
be classified as—

_(a) deliberate or reckless;_

_(b)_ careless; or

_(c)_ innocent.

(4) A misrepresentation is deliberate or reckless if the consumer knew

that—

_(a) it was untrue or misleading, or did not care whether or not it was_

untrue or misleading; and

_(b)_ the matter to which the misrepresentation related was relevant to

the licensed takaful operator, or did not care whether or not it was
relevant to the licensed takaful operator.

(5) A misrepresentation made dishonestly is to be regarded as having being

made deliberately or recklessly.

(6) A misrepresentation is careless or innocent, as the case may be, if it

is not deliberate or reckless.


-----

_Islamic Financial Services_ 253

(7) It is for the licensed takaful operator to show that a misrepresentation

was deliberate or reckless on a balance of probability.

(8) Unless the contrary is shown, it is to be presumed that the consumer

knew that a matter about which the licensed takaful operator asked a clear
and specific question was relevant to the licensed takaful operator.

**Group takaful certificates**

8. (1) This paragraph shall apply to a group takaful certificate which so
far as the cover for a person covered under that group takaful certificate is
concerned, such takaful certificate, if entered into, varied or renewed by the
person covered instead of the group takaful participant, would have been a
consumer takaful contract referred to in subsubparagraph 7(1)(b).

(2) So far as the cover for a person covered referred to in subparagraph (1)

is concerned—

_(a)_ paragraph 5 shall apply in relation to any disclosure, answer or

representation made by the person covered to the licensed takaful
operator as if the person covered was proposing to enter into, vary
or renew a consumer takaful contract for the relevant cover with
the licensed takaful operator; and

_(b)_ subject to subparagraphs (3) and (4) and the modifications set out

in Division 3 of Part 3 of this Schedule to the licensed takaful
operator’s remedies in Division 2 of Part 3 of this Schedule, the
remaining provisions of this Schedule shall apply in relation to the
cover for the person covered as if the person covered had entered
into, varied or renewed a consumer takaful contract for that cover
with the licensed takaful operator.

(3) Subsubparagraph _7(2)(b) shall apply to a group takaful certificate as_

if it reads as follows—

“the licensed takaful operator shows that had it known the true facts,

it would not have provided cover for the person covered, agreed to the
variation or renewal or would only have done so on different terms.”

(4) A breach of the duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation

under paragraph 5 on the part of one of any of the persons whose life is covered
under a group takaful certificate shall not affect the takaful certificate so far
as it relates to the other persons whose life are covered under that takaful
certificate.

(5) Nothing in this paragraph shall affect any duty owed by the group

takaful participant to the licensed takaful operator, or any remedy which the
licensed takaful operator may have against the group takaful participant for
breach of such a duty.


-----

254 _Bill_

**Entering into contract of takaful on another person whose life is**
**covered**

9. Where a consumer enters into a consumer takaful contract on another
person whose life is covered who is not a party to the contract, any information
provided to the licensed takaful operator by the person whose life is covered,
whether requested or otherwise, is to be treated for purposes of this Schedule
as if it was provided by the consumer and shall be subject to paragraph 5.

**Warranties and representations**

10. Any representation made before a consumer takaful contract was entered

into, varied or renewed shall not be converted into a warranty by means of
any provision of the consumer takaful contract or of any terms of the variation
or of any other contract, whether by declaring the representation to form the
basis of the contract or otherwise.

**Takaful operator’s,** **_etc. pre-contractual duty of disclosure_**

11. (1) No licensed takaful operator, takaful agent, approved takaful broker,
approved Islamic financial adviser or Islamic financial adviser’s representative
in order to induce a person to enter into, vary or renew, or offer to enter
into, vary or renew, a contract of takaful, whether or not a consumer takaful
contract, with it or through him—

_(a)_ shall make a statement which is misleading, false or deceptive, whether

fraudulently or otherwise;

_(b)_ shall fraudulently conceal a material fact; or

_(c)_ in the case of a takaful agent, use any marketing brochure or product

illustration not authorized by the licensed takaful operator.

(2) Where a person is induced to enter into, vary or renew a contract of

takaful in a manner described in subparagraph (1), the contract of takaful
shall be voidable and the person shall be entitled to rescind it.

**Knowledge of, and statement by takaful agent**

12. (1) A person who is authorized by a licensed takaful operator to be
its takaful agent and who solicits or negotiates a contract of takaful in that
capacity shall be deemed, for the purpose of the formation or variation of the
contract of takaful, to be the agent of the licensed takaful operator and the
knowledge of that takaful agent shall be deemed to be the knowledge of the
licensed takaful operator.


-----

_Islamic Financial Services_ 255

(2) A statement made, or an act done, by the takaful agent shall be deemed,

for the purpose of the formation or variation of the contract of takaful, to be a
statement made, or act done, by the licensed takaful operator notwithstanding
the takaful agent’s contravention of subparagraph 11(1) or any other provision
of this Act.

(3) Subparagraph (1) shall not apply—

_(a) where there is collusion or connivance between the takaful agent and_

the proposer in the formation or variation of the contract of takaful;
or

_(b) where a person has ceased to be a takaful agent of a licensed takaful_

operator and the licensed takaful operator has taken all reasonable
steps to inform, or bring to the knowledge of takaful participants
of the fact of such cessation.

Part 3

_Division 1—Non-contestability_

**Non-contestability for family takaful contracts**

13. (1) This paragraph shall apply to contracts of family takaful, whether or
not consumer takaful contracts.

(2) Where a contract of family takaful has been in effect for a period of

more than two years during the lifetime of the person whose life is covered,
such a contract shall not be avoided by a licensed family takaful operator
on the ground that a statement made or omitted to be made in the proposal
for takaful or in a report of a doctor, referee, or any other person, or in a
document leading to the issue of the family takaful certificate, was inaccurate
or false or misleading unless the licensed family takaful operator shows that
the statement was on a material matter or suppressed a material fact and that
it was fraudulently made or omitted to be made by the takaful participant or
the person whose life is covered.

(3) Where a licensed family takaful operator avoids a contract of takaful

under subparagraph (2), the licensed family takaful operator shall return
such moneys due under such contract of takaful as may be specified by the
Bank.

(4) For the purposes of subparagraph (2), “material matter” or “material

fact” means a matter or fact which, if known by the licensed family takaful
operator, would have led to its refusal to issue a family takaful certificate to
the takaful participant or would have led it to impose terms less favourable to
the takaful participant than those imposed in the family takaful certificate.

Division 2

Remedies for misrepresentation

**Application of Division**

14. This Division sets out the remedies available to a licensed takaful operator

for a misrepresentation by a consumer made in respect of—

_(a) a consumer takaful contract of family takaful which has been effected_

for a period of two years or less; and

_(b) a consumer takaful contract of general takaful._

**Remedies for deliberate or reckless misrepresentation**

15. (1) If a misrepresentation was deliberate or reckless, a licensed takaful
operator may avoid the consumer takaful contract and refuse all claims.

(2) Where the licensed takaful operator avoids a contract under subparagraph (1),

the licensed takaful operator shall return such moneys due under such contract
as may be specified by the Bank.

**Remedies for careless or innocent misrepresentation**

16. (1) If a misrepresentation was careless or innocent, the licensed takaful
operator’s remedies shall be based on what it would have done if the consumer
had complied with the duty set out in paragraph 5 and subparagraphs (2) to
(4) are to be read accordingly.

(2) If the licensed takaful operator would not have entered into or renewed

the consumer takaful contract on any terms, the licensed takaful operator may
avoid the contract and refuse all claims, but shall return to the consumer such
moneys due under such contract as may be specified by the Bank.

(3) If the licensed takaful operator would have entered into, or renewed, the

consumer takaful contract, but on different terms excluding terms relating to
the takaful contributions, the contract is to be treated as if it had been entered
into or renewed on those different terms if the licensed takaful operator so
requires.

(4) In addition, if the licensed takaful operator would have entered into or

renewed the consumer takaful contract, whether the terms relating to matters
other than the takaful contributions would have been the same or different,
but would have charged a higher takaful contribution, the licensed takaful
operator may reduce proportionately the amount to be paid on a claim as may
be specified by the Bank.

**Future treatment of contract**

17. (1) This paragraph shall apply if a misrepresentation was careless or
innocent but does not relate to any outstanding claim.


-----

_Islamic Financial Services_ 257

(2) Where a licensed takaful operator discovers a misrepresentation that was

careless or innocent and if the licensed takaful operator would not have entered
into or renewed the consumer takaful contract on any terms, subparagraph 16(2)
will apply.

(3) If the licensed takaful operator would have entered into or renewed

the consumer takaful contract, but on different terms or for a higher takaful
contribution or both, the licensed takaful operator shall either notify the
consumer that it intends to treat the contract as subsisting on different terms or
it may terminate the contract by giving reasonable notice to the consumer.

(4) Where the consumer receives notice that the licensed takaful operator

intends to continue the consumer takaful contract on different terms, the
consumer has a choice of either continuing the contract on those amended
terms or terminating the contract by giving reasonable notice to the licensed
takaful operator.

(5) Where either the licensed takaful operator or the consumer terminates

the contract under this paragraph, the licensed takaful operator shall refund
such moneys due under such contract as may be specified by the Bank.

(6) Termination of a consumer takaful contract under this paragraph does

not affect the treatment of any claim arising under the contract in the period
before termination and any such claim arising shall be dealt with accordingly
under paragraph 16.

(7) Nothing in this paragraph shall affect any contractual right of the parties

to terminate the consumer takaful contract.

**Variations**

18. (1) Where a misrepresentation is made by a consumer in respect of a
variation to an existing consumer takaful contract, it is necessary to ascertain
whether the subject matter of the variation can reasonably be treated separately
from the subject matter of the rest of the contract.

(2) If the subject matter of the variation can reasonably be treated separately

from the subject matter of the rest of the consumer takaful contract, the
remedies set out in this Division shall apply only in relation to that variation
as it applies in relation to a contract.

(3) If the subject matter of the variation cannot be treated separately from the

subject matter of the rest of the consumer takaful contract, the misrepresentation
shall be treated as if it had been made in relation to the whole contract and
the remedies set out in this Division shall apply in relation to the whole of
the contract of takaful rather than merely in relation to the variation.

person of sound mind who has attained the age of eighteen years and who is
not a nominee named under that subparagraph.

executor;

_(b) shall record the nomination and the particulars of the nominee in its_

the takaful participant and the nomination shall take effect from the

takaful participant and such takaful benefits so transferred shall not form part
of the estate of the deceased takaful participant or be subject to his debts.

(3) Where the takaful benefits are paid under a conditional _hibah, if it is_

proved that the takaful certificate was effected and the takaful contributions
were paid with intent to defraud a creditor of the takaful participant, the
creditor shall be entitled to receive from the takaful benefits payable under
the takaful certificate a sum equal to the takaful contributions paid under that
takaful certificate.

(4) Notwithstanding subparagraph (3), if a beneficiary received the takaful

benefits in good faith, and such benefits have been utilised by the beneficiary,

benefits are less than the takaful contributions paid.

an application for a licence or approval.

Schedule 8 sets out certain provisions relating to takaful certificates such as

those dealing with misstatement of age of the person covered, the fifteen day
cooling-off period for the return of a family takaful certificate by a takaful
participant, the payment of family takaful benefits by a takaful operator
without any deductions made unless consent has been obtained, the payment of
surrender value under a family takaful certificate, the effect of non-payment of
takaful contributions for a family takaful certificate and election by a takaful
participant to exchange his family takaful certificate for a paid-up family takaful
certificate. This Schedule also requires a takaful participant entering into such
contract of family takaful on a person covered other than himself to have a
permissible takaful interest in that person at the time the contract of takaful is
entered into, failing which the contract of takaful will be void. However, such
contract shall not be void by reason only that the takaful participant did not
have such permissible takaful interest at the time the takaful benefits becomes
payable. In such a situation, this Schedule requires the takaful operator to pay
to the takaful participant such moneys payable under the contract of family
takaful as may be specified by the Bank and upon such payment, the contract
of takaful is deemed to be terminated. A person entering into a contract of
family takaful on a person covered other than himself where that person is
his spouse, child or a ward under the age of majority, employee or any person
on whom he is wholly or partly dependent for maintenance or education, is
deemed by the Proposed Act to have a permissible takaful interest in them.
On the capacity of minors, this Schedule makes provision for a minor aged
ten years but less than sixteen years with consent of a parent or guardian
to enter into a contract of family takaful on his life or upon another person
in which he has a permissible takaful interest, or to assign a family takaful
certificate on his life or take an assignment of a family takaful certificate. A
minor aged sixteen years and above may do the same without consent of a
parent or guardian except when he assigns a family takaful certificate on his
life. The Schedule further sets out certain requirements on disclosure, group
takaful certificates and refund of takaful contribution.

Schedule 9 sets out a new duty of disclosure and representations for a

consumer to observe before a contract of takaful is entered into, varied or
renewed with a takaful operator. This duty applies only to consumer takaful
contracts which are defined as contracts of takaful that an individual enters
into wholly for purposes unrelated to his trade, business or profession, and
replaces the duty for the consumer to volunteer all relevant information to
the takaful operator with a duty for the consumer to take reasonable care not
to make a misrepresentation during the pre-contractual stage. In this respect,
a takaful operator may ask a consumer to answer specific questions and the
consumer will be required to take reasonable care that his answers to the
questions are accurate and complete. This Schedule also sets out proportionate
remedies that a takaful operator may rely on in the case of a misrepresentation
made by a consumer during the pre-contractual stage depending on the type of


-----

314 _Bill_

misrepresentation made. Where a consumer has made a deliberate or reckless
misrepresentation, the takaful operator may avoid the contract of takaful and
refuse the payment of any claim. Where a consumer has made a careless or
innocent misrepresentation, the takaful operator’s remedy shall be based on
what it would have done had the consumer not made any misrepresentation.
Hence, if the takaful operator would not have entered into the contract of
takaful at all, it may refuse all claims but shall return the moneys due under
such contract of takaful as may be specified by the Bank. If the takaful operator
would have entered into the contract on different terms, the contract of takaful
may be taken to include those different terms. If the takaful contribution
would have been higher, the takaful operator may reduce the claim amount
proportionately as may be specified by the Bank. This Schedule also provides
that all contracts of family takaful, whether consumer takaful contracts or not,
are non-contestable in relation to any inaccurate, false or misleading statement
leading to the issue of the family takaful certificate, if these contracts have
been in force for more than two years from the date on which they were
entered into during the lifetime of the person covered. Such contracts are
only contestable if a takaful operator can show that a statement made was on
a material matter or a material fact was suppressed and such statement was
fraudulently made or omitted. Provisions relating to the duty of disclosure and
representations for group takaful certificates and variations, takaful operator’s
duty of disclosure, prohibition on warranties in respect of any pre-contractual
representations made by consumers, prohibiting on contracting out and the
application of the Schedule are also set out.

Schedule 10 provides for the payment of takaful benefits under family

takaful certificate or personal accident takaful certificate which has been entered
into by the takaful participant on his life. The purpose of this Schedule is to
expedite the payment of takaful benefits upon death of the takaful participant.
The provisions of this Schedule empower a takaful participant who is aged
sixteen and above to nominate an individual to receive the takaful benefits
payable on the takaful participant death, and to revoke such nomination in
certain circumstances. This Schedule also provides the effect of nomination as
an executor or, as a beneficiary under conditional hibah. Where the nomination
as beneficiary is made, upon death of the takaful participant, ownership of
such takaful benefits shall be transferred to the beneficiary and shall not form
part of the estate of the deceased takaful participant or be subject to his debts.
This Schedule also provides for the claim of an assignee and pledgee to have
priority over the claim of any nominee, whether as executor or beneficiary.
Where a takaful participant has not made any nomination under his takaful
certificate, this Schedule sets out to whom the takaful benefits are to be paid,
starting with the lawful executor or administrator of the takaful participant,
and where there are no such persons, then to the proper claimant. Further
provision is made for the payment of takaful benefits to persons who are
incompetent to contract, whether they are nominees or not, as the case may
be. Takaful operators are also required to pay a minimum compensation as
may be specified by the Bank, on the amount of takaful benefits upon expiry
of the sixty days until the date of payment, on takaful benefits which remain
unpaid.

Schedule 11 sets out the permitted disclosures where the duty to preserve

secrecy imposed under _clause 145 does not apply._
