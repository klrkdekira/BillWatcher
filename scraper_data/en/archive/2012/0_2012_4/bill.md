commencement of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend paragraph 18(1)(c) of Act 441 to remove the_
requirement to state the par value of share capital and to introduce the concept
of no par value of share capital. This amendment will provide clarity on the
implementation of the no par value concept.

the annual fee provisions for both Labuan company and foreign Labuan

section referred to in this provision to section 53 which provides for the
reduction of share capital. Section 48a provides for the buyback share.
