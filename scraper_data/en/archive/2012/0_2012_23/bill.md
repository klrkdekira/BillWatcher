EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Medical Act 1971 [“Act 50”] to make amendments
in relation to the Malaysian Medical Council and to provide for the functions
and powers of the Council and for other matters connected therewith. The
objects of the proposed Act are to strengthen the administration of the
Malaysian Medical Council and to enhance the registration and regulation of
the medical profession.

The proposed Act introduces the establishment of a Medical Qualifying
Committee to look into the accreditation and recognition of qualifications of
both local and international training institutions. The proposed Act also seeks
to write down Registered Practitioners with Specialist Qualifications in the
Register since the present Act stipulates for the write down of only practitioners
with basic qualification. Other important features of the proposed amendments
are the introduction of production of evidence of any requirement stipulated
by the Council and insurance indemnity as prerequisite to renew the Annual
Practicing Certificate. This is to ensure protection for both the practitioners
