issued to him under subsection (2).

(4) In any case relating to the commission of an offence under

on oath from the Commissioner or authorized officer and after
such inquiry as he considers necessary, that there is reasonable

-----

118 _Bill_

legislation is being or has been committed on any premises, so
that any evidence or thing which is necessary to the conduct of
an investigation into an offence may be found in any premises,
the Magistrate may issue a warrant authorizing the Commissioner
or any authorized officer named in the warrant to enter the
premises at any reasonable time by day or by night, with or
without assistance, and if need be by force and there to search
for and seize any such evidence or thing, provided that nothing

in the custody of the postal or telegraph authorities.

equivalent net lettable area by taking into account its large circulation area
or vertical transportation core (lifts or escalators) in the whole floor parcel.

area that has been made appurtenant to a parcel and cannot be disposed of
independently of the parcel.

(5) For the purpose of ascertaining the weightage factor in accessory parcels,

the following interpretations shall apply:

accessory parcel is located on a part of the development area which
is outside a building and is neither part nor deemed to be part of a
