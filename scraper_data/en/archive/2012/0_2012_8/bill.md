EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996
(“Act 555”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 555 to introduce a new definition
of “Campus” to clarify a private higher educational institution’s perimeters
for the purpose of the exercise of rights under the new section 47.

4.  Clause 3 seeks to substitute for section 47 of Act 555 a new section 47.

The proposed subsection 47(1) seeks to extend the students’ right of

association to include the right to become a member of any political party. The
existing section 47 of Act 555 does not allow students to become members
of political parties.

The proposed paragraphs 47(2)(a) and (b) provide restrictions on students

in respect of becoming members of an unlawful society, _etc., and members_
of a society, _etc., which the Registrar General determines to be unsuitable to_
the interests and well-being of the students or the private higher educational
institution. However, the determination by the Registrar General under the
proposed paragraph 47(2)(b) shall not include a political party.

The proposed paragraph 47(2)(c) seeks to prohibit a student from running

for election to or holding any post in any society, organization, body or
group of students in the Campus if he holds any post in a political party. The
prohibition seeks to maintain neutrality in the Campus.

The proposed paragraph 47(2)(d) seeks to impose restrictions on students’

involvement in political party activities inside the Campus. These restrictions
seek to maintain neutrality in the Campus. However, no restriction is imposed
on students’ political party activities outside the Campus.

The proposed subsection 47(3) seeks to remove the restriction imposed on

students and societies, organizations, bodies or groups of students in expressing
or doing anything which may reasonably be construed as expressing support
for or sympathy with or opposition to any political party. This is consistent
with the Court of Appeal’s decision in the case of _Muhammad Hilman Idham_


-----

_Private Higher Educational Institutions (Amendment)_ 5

_& Ors v Kerajaan Malaysia & Ors [2011] 9 CLJ 50. However, the subsection_
maintains the restrictions in the existing subsection 47(1c) of Act 555 whereby
the students and societies, organizations, bodies or groups of students are
not allowed to express or do anything which may reasonably be construed as
expressing support for or sympathy with or opposition to any unlawful society,
organization, _etc., and any society, organization,_ _etc., which the Registrar_
General determines to be unsuitable to the interests and well-being of the
students or the private higher education institution.

The proposed subsection 47(4) seeks to provide the exceptions to the

restrictions imposed in the proposed subsection 47(1c) as provided under the
existing section 47 of Act 555.

The proposed subsection 47(5) seeks to impose an obligation on the chief

executive to comply with the directions of the Registrar General in regulating
activities of students, or students’ organization, body or group, inside the
Campus.

The proposed subsection 47(6) provides that the private higher educational

institution which fails to comply with the directions of the Registrar General
under subsection (5) commits an offence and shall be liable to a fine.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to provide for savings provision.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
