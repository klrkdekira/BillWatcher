(“Act 301”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

to print or publish a newspaper in Malaysia or in granting the proprietor of
any newspaper in Singapore a permit allowing such newspaper to be imported,
sold, circulated or distributed in Malaysia.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 12 of Act 301 to remove the period of_
validity for a licence or permit and to allow such licence or permit to remain
valid for so long as it is not revoked.

prohibition of judicial review on the decision of the Minister to grant, refuse
to grant, revoke or suspend a licence or permit under Act 301.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 13b of Act 301 to give a person an_
opportunity to be heard before a decision to revoke or suspend such licence
