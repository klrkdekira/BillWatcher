AMENDMENTS TO THE INCOME TAX ACT 1967

Chapter II of this Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1967.

1. _Clause 4_ seeks to amend subsection 2(1) of Act 53 to introduce a new
definition of “business trust” into Act 53 and to include in the definition
of “company” a business trust. With the amendment, the tax treatment of a
business trust is similar to a company under the Act.

This amendment comes into operation on the coming into operation of the
Capital Markets and Services (Amendment) Act 2012 [Act A1437].

_Clause 4 further seeks to amend the definition of “Central Bank” as a_
consequence of the enactment of the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009

[Act 701].

This amendment comes into operation on the coming into operation of
this Act.


-----

38 _Bill_

_Clause 4_ further seeks to introduce a new definition of “limited liability
partnership” into Act 53 as a limited liability partnership registered under
the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2012 and to extend the definition of
“person” to a “limited liability partnership”. With the amendment, a limited
liability partnership will be treated as an entity chargeable to tax.

_Clause 4_ further seeks to amend the definition of “partnership” to provide
that a limited liability partnership is not a partnership under this Act.

These amendments come into operation on the coming into operation of the
Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2012 [Act 743].

_Clause 4_ further seeks to introduce a new definition of “treasury shares”
into Act 53. The amendment is consequential to the amendment in the Act
that gives special deduction to a company in the event the treasury shares are
offered to its employee.

This amendment has effect for the year of assessment 2013 and subsequent
years of assessment.

_Clause 4 further seeks to amend subsection 2(9) of Act 53 to exclude a_
business trust from enjoying benefits of not filing tax estimates and making
instalment payments pursuant to subsection 107C(4A), the special tax rate
under Schedule 1 and the special allowances for small value assets under
Schedule 3 of the Act.

_Clause 4 further seeks to introduce a new subsection 2(11) into Act 53 as_
a consequence of providing a similar tax treatment to a business trust as to
a company.

These amendments come into operation on the coming into operation of
the Capital Markets and Services (Amendment) Act 2012.

2. _Clause 5_ seeks to introduce a new section 4B into Act 53 to clarify that
interest income will not be taxable as gains or profits from a business under
paragraph 4(a) of the Act unless the interest is derived from a source which
forms part of the stock in trade of a business of a person or the interest is
receivable by a person from the business of lending money and that business
is licensed under any written law.

This amendment has effect for the year of assessment 2013 and subsequent
years of assessment.

3. _Clause 6 seeks to introduce a new paragraph 6(1)(l) into Act 53 to provide_
for tax to be charged at the rate specified under Part XVI of Schedule 1 to
the Act on income of an individual who withdraws his contribution made to
a private retirement scheme before the age of fifty-five other than by reason
of death or permanently leaving Malaysia.

This amendment comes into operation on 1 January 2013.


-----

_Finance (No. 2)_ 39

4. _Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new subsection 8(1A) into Act 53 to provide_
that the residence status of a limited liability partnership in Malaysia is
determined based on the management and control of its business or affairs
which are exercised by its partners in Malaysia.

This amendment comes into operation on the coming into operation of the
Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2012.

_Clause 7 further seeks to provide that the resident status of a business trust_
is determined based on the resident status of a trustee manager. The trustee
manager is resident in Malaysia if it carries on the business of the business
trust in Malaysia and the management and control of its business are exercised
in Malaysia.

This amendment comes into operation on the coming into operation of the
