irrelevant answer to any request by the licensed insurer under subparagraph
(1) or subsubparagraph (3)(a), or fails to confirm or amend any matter
under subsubparagraph (3)(b), or does so incompletely or provides irrelevant
information, as the case may be, and the answer or matter was not pursued

renewal, or would only have done so on different terms.

licensed insurer has a remedy in Division 2 against a consumer may be
classified as—

that—

_(a)_ it was untrue or misleading, or did not care whether or not it was

untrue or misleading; and

licensed insurer, or did not care whether or not it was relevant to
the insurer.

(5) A misrepresentation made dishonestly is to be regarded as having being

made deliberately or recklessly.

deliberate or reckless on a balance of probability.

knew that a matter about which the licensed insurer asked a clear and specific
question was relevant to the insurer.

**Group policies**

8. (1) This paragraph shall apply to a group policy which so far as the cover
for a person insured under that group policy is concerned, such policy, if
entered into, varied or renewed by the person insured instead of the group
policy owner, would have been a consumer insurance contract referred to in
subsubparagraph 7(1)(b).


-----

_Financial Services_ 249

(2) So far as the cover for the person insured referred to in subparagraph

(1) is concerned—

_(a)_ paragraph 5 shall apply in relation to any disclosure, answer or

representation made by the person insured to the licensed insurer as
if the person insured was proposing to enter into, vary or renew a
consumer insurance contract for the relevant cover with the insurer;
and

_(b)_ subject to subparagraphs (3) and (4) and the modifications set out

in Division 3 of Part 3 of this Schedule to the insurer’s remedies
in Division 2 of Part 3 of this Schedule, the remaining provisions
of this Schedule shall apply in relation to the cover for the person
insured as if the person insured had entered into, varied or renewed
a consumer insurance contract for that cover with the insurer.

(3) Subsubparagraph 7(2)(b) shall apply to a group policy as if it reads as

follows:

“the licensed insurer shows that had it known the true facts, it would
not have provided cover for the person insured, agreed to the variation
or renewal or would only have done so on different terms.”

(4) A breach of the duty to take reasonable care not to make a misrepresentation

under paragraph 5 on the part of one of any of the persons insured under a
group policy shall not affect the policy so far as it relates to the other persons
insured under that policy.

(5) Nothing in this paragraph shall affect any duty owed by the group

policy owner to the licensed insurer, or any remedy which the insurer may
have against the group policy owner for breach of such a duty.

11. (1) No licensed insurer, insurance agent, approved insurance broker,

renew, a contract of insurance, whether or not a consumer insurance contract,
with it or through him—

**Knowledge of, and statement by insurance agent**

12. (1) A person who is authorized by a licensed insurer to be its insurance
agent and who solicits or negotiates a contract of insurance in that capacity
shall be deemed, for the purpose of the formation or variation of the contract
of insurance, to be the agent of the insurer and the knowledge of that insurance
agent shall be deemed to be the knowledge of the insurer.

(2) A statement made, or an act done, by the insurance agent shall be deemed,

insurance agent’s contravention of subparagraph 11(1) or any other provision

**Non-contestability for life insurance contracts**

13. (1) This paragraph shall apply to contracts of life insurance, whether or
not consumer insurance contracts.


-----

_Financial Services_ 251

(2) Where a contract of life insurance has been in effect for a period of

more than two years during the lifetime of the insured, such a contract shall
not be avoided by a licensed life insurer on the ground that a statement made
or omitted to be made in the proposal for insurance or in a report of a doctor,
referee, or any other person, or in a document leading to the issue of the life
policy, was inaccurate or false or misleading unless the insurer shows that
the statement was on a material matter or suppressed a material fact and that
it was fraudulently made or omitted to be made by the policy owner or the
insured.

(3) For the purposes of subparagraph (2), “material matter” or “material

fact” means a matter or fact which, if known by the licensed life insurer,
would have led to its refusal to issue a life policy to the policy owner or
would have led it to impose terms less favourable to the policy owner than
those imposed in the life policy.

Division 2

Remedies for misrepresentation

**Application of Division**

14. This Division sets out the remedies available to a licensed insurer for a
misrepresentation by a consumer made in respect of—

_(a) a consumer insurance contract of life insurance which has been effected_

for a period of two years or less; and

_(b)_ a consumer insurance contract of general insurance.

**Remedies for deliberate or reckless misrepresentation**

15. If a misrepresentation was deliberate or reckless, a licensed insurer may
avoid the consumer insurance contract and refuse all claims.

**Remedies for careless or innocent misrepresentation**

16. (1) If a misrepresentation was careless or innocent, the licensed insurer’s
remedies shall be based on what it would have done if the consumer had
complied with the duty set out in paragraph 5 and subparagraphs (2) to (4)
are to be read accordingly.

(2) If the licensed insurer would not have entered into or renewed the

consumer insurance contract on any terms, the insurer may avoid the contract
and refuse all claims, but shall return to the consumer any premium paid by
him.

(3) If the licensed insurer would have entered into or renewed the consumer

insurance contract, but on different terms excluding terms relating to the
premium, the contract is to be treated as if it had been entered into or renewed
on those different terms if the insurer so requires.


-----

252 _Bill_

(4) In addition, if the licensed insurer would have entered into or renewed

the consumer insurance contract, whether the terms relating to matters other
than the premium would have been the same or different, but would have
charged a higher premium, the insurer may reduce proportionately the amount
to be paid on a claim as may be specified by the Bank.

**Future treatment of contract**

17. (1) This paragraph shall apply if a misrepresentation was careless or
innocent but does not relate to any outstanding claim.

(2) Where a licensed insurer discovers a misrepresentation that was careless

or innocent and if the insurer would not have entered into or renewed the
consumer insurance contract on any terms, subparagraph 16(2) will apply.

(3) If the licensed insurer would have entered into or renewed the consumer

insurance contract, but on different terms or for a higher premium or both,
the insurer shall either notify the consumer that it intends to treat the contract
as subsisting on different terms or it may terminate the contract by giving
reasonable notice to the consumer.

(4) Where the consumer receives notice that the licensed insurer intends

to continue the consumer insurance contract on different terms, the consumer
has a choice of either continuing with the contract on those amended terms
or terminating the contract by giving reasonable notice to the insurer.

(5) Where either the licensed insurer or the consumer terminates the

contract under this paragraph, the insurer shall refund any premium paid for
the terminated cover in respect of the balance of the contract term.

(6) Termination of a consumer insurance contract under this paragraph does

not affect the treatment of any claim arising under the contract in the period
before termination and any such claim arising shall be dealt with accordingly
under paragraph 16.

(7) Nothing in this paragraph shall affect any contractual right of the parties

to terminate the consumer insurance contract.

**Variations**

18. (1) Where a misrepresentation is made by a consumer in respect of a
variation to an existing consumer insurance contract, it is necessary to ascertain
whether the subject matter of the variation can reasonably be treated separately
from the subject matter of the rest of the contract.

(2) If the subject matter of the variation can reasonably be treated separately

from the subject matter of the rest of the consumer insurance contract, the
remedies set out in this Division shall apply only in relation to that variation
as it applies in relation to a contract.


-----

_Financial Services_ 253

(3) If the subject matter of the variation cannot be treated separately

from the subject matter of the rest of the consumer insurance contract, the
misrepresentation shall be treated as if it had been made in relation to the
whole contract and the remedies set out in this Division shall apply in relation
to the whole of the contract rather than merely in relation to the variation.

Division 3

Modifications for group policies

**Modifications for group policies**

19. This Division provides for the application of Division 2 of this Part to

a group policy in accordance with the following modifications—

_(a) reference to consumer insurance contract, however described in Division_

2, shall be references to that part of the group policy which provides
for cover for the person insured who made the misrepresentation;

_(b) reference to claims and premium shall be references to claims and_

premium in relation to the cover for the person insured who made
the misrepresentation;

_(c)_ any refund of premium under subparagraph 16(2) or 17(5) shall be

made to the person insured if he had paid the premium for his cover;
and

_(d) in respect of the cover for the person insured, the right to terminate_

his cover wherever referred to in Division 2, shall be that of the
group policy owner.

incompetent nominee other than the policy owner and where there is
no surviving parent, the Public Trustee or a trust company nominated

being preserved, the licensed insurer shall pay the balance of the policy moneys
to the nominee.

assignment, the respective rights of the persons entitled under the security or

(5) Policy moneys paid under this paragraph shall be deemed to have been

consent has been obtained, the payment of surrender value under a life policy,

which the insurance will be void. A person effecting insurance on the life of
his spouse, child or a ward under the age of majority, employee or any person

308 _Bill_

but less than sixteen years with consent of a parent or guardian to effect a
life policy on his own life or upon another life in which he has an insurable
interest, or to assign a life policy on his own life or take an assignment of a
life policy. A minor aged sixteen years and above may do the same without
consent of a parent or guardian except when he assigns a life policy on his
own life. The Schedule further sets out certain requirements on disclosure,
group policies and refund of premium.

_Schedule 9 sets out a new duty of disclosure and representations for a_

consumer to observe before a contract of insurance is entered into, varied
or renewed with an insurer. This duty applies only to consumer insurance
contracts which are defined as contracts of insurance that an individual enters
into wholly for purposes unrelated to his trade, business or profession, and
replaces the duty for a consumer to volunteer all relevant information to the
insurer with a duty for the consumer to take reasonable care not to make a
misrepresentation during the pre-contractual stage. In this respect, an insurer
may ask a consumer to answer specific questions and the consumer will be
required to take reasonable care that his answers to the questions are accurate
and complete. This Schedule also sets out proportionate remedies which an
insurer may rely on in the case of a misrepresentation made by a consumer
during the pre-contractual stage depending on the type of misrepresentation
made. Where a consumer has made a deliberate or reckless misrepresentation,
the insurer may avoid the contract of insurance and refuse the payment of any
claim. Where a consumer has made a careless or innocent misrepresentation,
the insurer’s remedy shall be based on what it would have done had the
consumer not made any misrepresentation. Hence, if the insurer would not
have entered into the contract of insurance at all, it may refuse all claims but
shall return all premiums to the consumer. If the insurer would have entered
into the contract on different terms, the contract of insurance may be taken
to include those different terms. If the premium would have been higher, the
insurer may reduce the claim amount proportionately. Apart from setting out
the new duty of disclosure and representations for consumer insurance contracts,
this Schedule retains the existing duty of utmost good faith to be observed
by persons who enter, vary or renew a contract of insurance which is not a
consumer insurance contract. This Schedule also continues to provide that all
contracts of life insurance, whether consumer insurance contracts or not, are
non-contestable in relation to any inaccurate, false or misleading statement
leading to the issue of the life policy, if these contracts have been in force
for more than two years from the date on which they were effected during the
lifetime of the insured. Such contracts are only contestable if an insurer can
show that a statement made was on a material matter or a material fact was
suppressed and such statement was fraudulently made or omitted. Provisions
relating to the duty of disclosure and representations for group policies and
variations, insurer’s duty of disclosure, prohibition on warranties in respect
of any pre-contractual representations made by consumers, prohibition on
contracting out and the application of the Schedule are also set out.

_Schedule 10 provides for the payment of policy moneys upon death of_

a policy owner under a life policy or personal accident policy which has
been effected by the policy owner upon his own life. The purpose of this
Schedule is to expedite the payment of policy moneys upon death of the
policy owner. The provisions of this Schedule empower a policy owner who


-----

_Financial Services_ 309

is aged sixteen and above to nominate an individual to receive the policy
moneys payable on the policy owner’s death, and to revoke such nomination
in certain circumstances. Where a policy owner nominates his spouse, child or
if there is no spouse or child at the time of nomination, his parent, to receive
the policy moneys, a trust is created in favour of such a nominee, who will
receive the policy moneys beneficially. Payment of policy moneys under such
a trust are protected as the policy moneys will not form part of the policy
owner’s estate or be subject to his debts. All other persons nominated under
a life policy do not receive the policy moneys beneficially but as executor,
and the policy moneys will form part of the policy owner’s estate and be
subject to his debts. This Schedule also provides for the claim of an assignee
and pledgee to have priority over the claim of any nominee, whether a trust
nominee or otherwise. Where a policy owner has not made any nomination
under his policy, this Schedule sets out to whom the policy moneys are to be
paid, starting with the lawful executor or administrator of the policy owner,
and where there are no such persons, then to the policy owner’s spouse, child
or parent according to the Distribution Act 1958 [Act 300]. In the event that
there is no spouse, child or parent, the Schedule also provides for certain
other persons to be able to receive the policy moneys. Further provision is
made for the payment of policy moneys to persons who are incompetent to
contract, whether they are nominees or not, as the case may be. Insurers are
also required to pay interest on policy moneys that remain unpaid for sixty
days from the date of notification of a claim.

_Schedule 11 sets out the permitted disclosures where the duty to preserve_

secrecy imposed under _clause 133 does not apply._

_Schedule 12 seeks to provide a list of persons excluded from the restrictions_

on use of certain words.

_Schedule 13 seeks to modify provisions in the Third Schedule of the Central_

Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 for the purposes of a vesting order made by the
Bank in respect of the vesting of businesses, assets or liabilities under _clause_
_176._

_Schedule 14 seeks to set out the list of transactions prohibited under_

_subclause_ _214(2)._

_Schedule 15 seeks to provide a list of provisions in respect of which the_

Bank may impose an administrative monetary penalty.

_Schedule 16 sets out the list of subsidiary legislation which is to be_

revoked.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATION_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
