EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Strata Titles Act 1985 (“the principal Act”) which
includes the insertion of a new Sixth Schedule to enable the implementation
of the Electronic Land Administration System for Strata Titles in Peninsular
Malaysia. The Bill also seeks to harmonize the provisions of the principal
Act and its relationship with the provisions of the National Land Code 1965
as the principal Act is construed as part of the National Land Code. This
Bill also seeks to carve out the provisions in the management of subdivided
building which is purposed to be governed by the Strata Management Act 201_

[Act ]. Consequently this Bill seeks to harmonize the provisions of the
principal Act with the provisions of the Strata Management Act 201_.


-----

_Strata Titles (Amendment)_ 59

_2. Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend the preamble of the principal Act to reflect_
the extension of the scope of the principal Act to the Federal Territory of
Labuan.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 to extend the application of the principal_
Act to the Federal Territory of Labuan.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4 of the principal Act to introduce new_
definitions as well as to amend existing definitions used in the principal
Act.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new section 4b to provide for the Electronic_
Land Administration System of Strata Titles and the application of a new Sixth
Schedule upon the coming into operation of the system.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to substitute section 7 of the principal Act. This amendment_
states that the original proprietor of alienated land may apply for subdivision
of a building or land.

8. _Clause 7_ seeks to substitute section 8 of the principal Act to strengthen
the circumstances in which the original proprietor is compelled to apply for
subdivision of building or land. Previously, an application of subdivision is
compulsory only upon sale or agreement to sell any parcel in a “completed
building” that is capable of being subdivided. However, this amendment provides
that an application for subdivision is compulsory even on building that is still
in progress, where sale or agreement to sell any parcel in such building took
place and document to certify the super structure stage has been issued. This
amendment further provides the relevant time period for such application to
be made.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section 8a to provide for the application_
for certificate of proposed strata plan. The certificate of proposed strata plan
is required to be submitted in the application for subdivision of building _etc._
under section 9 of the principal Act.

10. _Clause 9_ seeks to substitute section 9 of the principal Act to reduce

the duration of time for obtaining approval for subdivision of building _etc._
The new amendment imposes self-management on the land proprietor to
obtain the certificate of proposed strata plan from the Director of Survey
prior to making application for subdivision of land. As a result, when the
application for subdivision of building _etc. is made by the land proprietor,_
the Land Administrator can transmit the application to the Director with his
recommendations without having to postpone the process in order to get the
necessary certification from the Land Surveyor.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to insert new sections 9a and 9b to streamline the process_

of application for subdivision of building etc. in respect of provisional blocks
in the case of phased development, and in respect of subdivision of building
_etc. for low-cost buildings, respectively._


-----

60 _Bill_

12. _Clause 11 seeks to substitute section 10 of the principal Act in consequence_

of the introduction of the new section 8a and the amendment to section 9 of
the principal Act.

13. _Clause 12_ seeks to delete section 10a of the principal Act pursuant to

the insertion of the new section 9a.

14. _Clause 13_ seeks to delete section 10b of the principal Act pursuant to

the introduction of the new section 9b.

15. _Clause 14 seeks to make consequential amendments to section 11 of the_

principal Act and to further provide the procedure for withdrawal of application
for subdivision of building _etc._

16. _Clause 15 seeks to make consequential amendments to section 12 of the_
