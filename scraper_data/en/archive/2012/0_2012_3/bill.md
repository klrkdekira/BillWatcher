EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Election Offences Act 1954 (“Act 5”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and empowers the Minister to appoint_
the date of commencement of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 5 to introduce new definitions_
of “before an election”, “after an election” and “during an election” into Act
5.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 5 by substituting for the word_
“cast” the word “marked”. This amendment is made to avoid using the word
“dibuang” in the national language text. In the national language text, the word
“dibuang” is substituted with the word “ditandakan” as the word “dibuang”
may connote a negative interpretation for the purpose of an election.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to delete paragraph 11(1)(c) of Act 5 to remove a provision_
that is difficult to enforce.


-----

_Election Offences (Amendment)_ 7

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend section 14 of Act 5 to remove the mandatory
requirement for an election agent of a candidate to appoint any polling agent
or counting agent. The proposed amendment also allows an election agent of
a candidate to hire a political party office on behalf of the candidate.

The amendment in _clause 5_ also seeks to allow any polling agent or

counting agent of a candidate to act or be present or attend the counting
of votes at the polling station only at the time appointed by the Election
Commission. This is to reduce overcrowding at the polling station.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend subsection_ 24a(2) of Act 5 to avoid difficulties
relating to the existing requirement of a distance of fifty metres from the
limit of any place of nomination which does not have a large compound.
The amendment in _clause 6_ also gives the Election Commission power to
determine any other appropriate distance.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to introduce new subsections_ 24b(2a), (2b) and (2c) into
Act 5 to require that any office which is opened, established or maintained
during the campaign period under subsection 24b(2) is only opened, established
or maintained within a distance of not less than one hundred metres from the
polling centre.

The proposed amendment also provides that any contravention of the

proposed new subsection (2a) is a seizable offence which is punishable under
the proposed new subsection (2b).

The amendment in _clause 7_ also seeks to amend subsection 24b(7) of Act

5 to avoid difficulties relating to the existing requirement of a distance of
fifty metres from the limits of any polling centre which does not have a large
compound. The proposed amendment also empowers the Election Commission
to determine any other appropriate distance and to substitute the words “polling
station” with the words “polling centre” to reflect the meaning as assigned to
those words in section 2 of the Elections Act 1958 [Act 19].

9. _Subclause 8(a) seeks to amend paragraph 26(1)(c) of Act 5 by substituting_
for the words “committee-room” the words “the political party office” as a
consequential amendment to the proposed amendment in paragraph 14(1)(b)
of Act 5.

10. _Subclause 8(b) seeks to amend paragraph 26(1)(e) of Act 5 by deleting_

the words “within the distance of fifty metres from the limits of any polling
station—” to remove the qualification of the distance of fifty metres for the
purpose of committing any offence under paragraph 26(1)(e) of Act 5.

The amendment in _subclause 8(b) also seeks to renumber the existing_

subparagraphs 26(1)(e)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Act 5 as paragraphs 26(1)
_(e), (ea), (eb)_ and (ec) respectively by making the offences referred in the
existing subparagraphs 26(1)(e)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) as separate and distinct
offences.

11. _Subclause 8(c) seeks to amend the renumbered paragraph 26(1)(e) and_

_(ea) by substituting for the words “polling station” the words “polling centre”._
This is to reflect the meaning as assigned to those words in section 2 of the
Elections Act 1958.


-----

8 _Bill_

12. _Subclause 8(d) seeks to amend the renumbered paragraph 26(1)(ec) of_

Act 5 to prohibit any person during polling day from waiting or loitering
within a distance of one hundred metres from the limits of any polling centre
except for the purpose of gaining entry to the polling centre.

The amendment in _subclause 8(d) also seeks to amend the renumbered_

paragraph 26(1)(ec) of Act 5 by substituting for the words “polling station”
the words “polling centre”. This is to reflect the meaning as assigned to those
words in section 2 of the Elections Act 1958.

Further, the amendment in _subclause 8(d)_ also seeks to substitute for the

words “cast his vote” the word “vote”. Amendment to the words “cast his vote”
in the English language text is made pursuant to the amendment to the words
“membuang undinya” in the national language text. In the national language
text, the words “membuang undinya” is substituted with the word “mengundi”
as the word “membuang undinya” may connote a negative interpretation for
the purpose of an election.

13. _Subclause 8(e) seeks to amend paragraph 26(1)(g) of Act 5 to substitute_

the existing distance of fifty metres with the distance of one hundred metres
to avoid difficulties relating to the existing distance requirement in the case
of polling centres which do not have large compounds.

The amendment in _subclause 8(e)_ also seeks to substitute for the words

“any polling station” the words “any polling centre” to reflect the meaning
as assigned to those words in section 2 of the Elections Act 1958.

14. _Clause 9_ seeks to delete subsections 26a(2) and (3) of Act 5 as the

attendance of observers at the booths causes difficulties to the election workers
in performing their duties.

15. _Clause 10 seeks to substitute section 27d of Act 5 with a new provision_

that allows for the establishment of an enforcement team in a Parliamentary
or State constituency.

16. _Clause 11 seeks to amend section 30a of Act 5 to provide for an application_

for an authorized excuse under section 30 of Act 5 to be made within thirty
days after the expiration of the period of thirty-one days specified in section
23 of Act 5. However, until the application for such excuse is allowed by
an Election Judge or a Judge of the High Court, the candidate cannot sit or
vote.

17. _Clause 12 seeks to amend FORM A of the First Schedule to add individuals_

before whom the oath of secrecy may be sworn.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
