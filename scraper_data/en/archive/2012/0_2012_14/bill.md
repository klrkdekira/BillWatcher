EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The proposed Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (“the proposed
Act”) seeks to provide for special measures in dealing with security offences
as defined in the proposed Act. The proposed Act seeks to repeal the Internal
Security Act 1960 [Act 82] while recognizing the grave risks to internal
security and public order presented by the threat of terrorism, sabotage and
espionage. Thus the proposed Act is made under Article 149 of the Federal
Constitution.

2. A highlight of Article 149 is that it allows for inconsistencies with Articles
5, 9, 10 and 13 of the Constitution as well as allows Parliament to make laws
outside its normal legislative competency.

3. The proposed Act is divided into eight Parts. The preliminary provisions
of the proposed Act are set out in _clause 1 (short title and commencement),_
_clause 2 (application) and_ _clause 3 (interpretation) after which follows_
Part II on special powers for security offences.

4. Of all the provisions of the proposed Act, clause 4 is the most important.
Under clause 4 a police officer has special powers of arrest and detention over
persons whom he has reason to believe to be involved in security offences. The
_clause is a departure from Article 5 of the Constitution where after twenty-four_
hours of police detention, a person may be further detained up to twentyeight days by the police for the purpose of investigation. Within that _clause_

_Security Offences (Special Measures)_ 23

too, those that are not further detained may be attached with an electronic
monitoring device for the remainder of the period of detention of twenty-eight
days. Notwithstanding the special powers of arrest and detention under this
_clause, an important element under this clause that must be emphasized is that_
no person shall be arrested under this _clause solely for his political belief or_
political activity.

5. _Clause 5 allows the detainee to immediately notify his next-of-kin and_
allows for the detainee to consult a legal practitioner but the right to consult
his legal practitioner can be delayed for up to forty-eight hours if there are
reasonable grounds for believing that the exercise of that right will interfere
with evidence connected to a security offence or it will lead to harm to another
or it will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having committed
such an offence but who are not yet arrested or it will hinder the recovery of
property obtained as a result of such an offence.

6. _Clause 6 provides for the power to intercept communication. Over and_
above the normal powers to intercept with the authorization of the Public
Prosecutor, a Superintendent of Police may intercept without authorization
in urgent and sudden cases where immediate action is required. If the police
acts without prior authorization, the clause requires the police to immediately
inform the Public Prosecutor.

7. Clause 7 sets out the procedures to be followed when the police intends
to attach an electronic monitoring device to assist investigation on a person
who is not further detained under _clause 4._

8. Part IV deals with special procedures relating to sensitive information. The
Part deals with three situations, firstly, where sensitive information will be used
as evidence in the trial by the Public Prosecutor, secondly when the accused
intends to use sensitive information in his defence and thirdly when sensitive
information arises in the course of the trial. Sensitive information is defined
in clause 3 as any document, information and material relating to the Cabinet,
Cabinet committees and State Executive Council or that concerns sovereignty,
national security, defence, public order and international relations whether or
not classified as “Top Secret”, “Secret”, “Confidential” or “Restricted” by a
minister, the Menteri Besar, Chief Minister of a State or any public officer
appointed by a minister.

9. _Clause 8 deals with the situation when sensitive information will be used_
as evidence. Under section 51A of the Criminal Procedure Code [Act 593] it
is mandatory for the prosecution to supply any document or report which will
form part of the prosecution’s case to the defence before the commencement
of trial. Clause 8 allows the Public Prosecutor to make an ex parte application
to the court to be exempted from the requirement under section 51A of the
Criminal Procedure Code. The _clause_ provides a safeguard to the accused
whereby his counsel shall be allowed to view the sensitive information and
submit against its admission if the accused objects to the admission of the
statement or summary of the sensitive information as evidence.

24 _Bill_

10. _Clause 9 deals with the opposite situation where the accused intends to_
use the sensitive information in his defence. The _clause requires the accused_
to give two days’ notice to the Public Prosecutor and the court in writing of
his intention to do so.

11. _Clause 10 provides for the procedure once the accused files a notice to_
use the sensitive information in his defence.

12. _Clause 11 meanwhile deals with the situation when sensitive information_
arises in the course of the trial under section 51 of the Criminal Procedure
Code. This _clause provides a safeguard in that the court shall not direct_
the Public Prosecutor to produce the statement or summary of the sensitive
information if the Minister certifies that the production of the statement or
summary is prejudicial to national security or national interest.

13. Part V deals with the trial. There are two _clauses_ in this Part. _Clause_
_12 provides for trial of security offences and_ _clause 13 deals with bail. As_
a general rule bail shall not be granted to an accused in a security offence
except if the accused falls within the exceptions of the clause. If bail is granted
under the exception, the Public Prosecutor may apply for the accused to be
attached with an electronic monitoring device in accordance with the Criminal
Procedure Code.

14. Part VI deals with special procedures relating to protected witnesses.
_Clause 14 provides for the special manner of giving evidence by a protected_
witness. _Clause 15 provides for identification by a witness where evidence_
is taken _in camera and_ _clause 16 provides for the protection of a witness’_
identity.

15. Part VII deals with evidence. There are 11 clauses in this Part. Clause 17
provides that Part VII shall have effect notwithstanding that it is inconsistent
with the Evidence Act 1950 [Act 56]. _Clause 18 provides for statements by_
any person who is dead and _etc._ _Clause 19 provides for conviction based_
on testimony of a child of tender years. _Clause 20 provides for documents_
seized during a raid or in the course of investigation. _Clause 21 provides_
for evidence of identification of the accused or other persons. _Clause 22_
provides for the search list to be admissible as evidence. _Clause 23 provides_
that non-production of exhibit shall not be prejudicial to the prosecution’s
case. _Clause 24 provides for admissibility of intercepted communication._
_Clause 25 provides for admissibility of documents produced by computers and_
of statements contained therein. Clause 26 provides for evidence of accomplice
and _agent provocateur._

16. Part VIII deals with the miscellaneous provisions in the proposed Act.
There are 5 _clauses_ in this Part. _Clause 27 provides for the power to record_
statements and confessions. Clause 28 provides for the protection of informers.
_Clause 29 provides for access of police to those detained or imprisoned._
_Clause 30 provides for detention pending exhaustion of legal process._
_Clause 31_ provides for the general power to make regulations. _Clause 32_ is
the final clause of the proposed Act and provides for the repeal of the Internal
Security Act 1960 and savings provision.

_Security Offences (Special Measures)_ 25

17. There are two Schedules in this proposed Act. The First Schedule is
the Schedule for offences in the Penal Code that are classified as security
offences. The Second Schedule is the form for the attachment of Electronic
Monitoring Device on those whose further detention is not necessary but the
police still requires their cooperation in the investigation.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
