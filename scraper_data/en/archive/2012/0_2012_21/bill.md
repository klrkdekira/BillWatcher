EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Legal Profession Act 1976 (“Act 166”).

2. _Clause 1 provides for the short title and commencement of the proposed_
Act.


-----

_Legal Profession (Amendment)_ 29

3. _Clause 2 seeks to delete subsection 13(5) of Act 166 as it is no longer_
relevant. This is because the period an officer must serve in the Judicial and
Legal Service in order to qualify for an exemption from serving any period
of pupillage for purposes of his admission as an advocate and solicitor has
been shortened to at least one year.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 37 of the Act to make it clear to foreign_
lawyers what they can or cannot do. Generally, the proposed amendment seeks
to provide for the offence for a foreign lawyer who does not purport to practise
in an international partnership, qualified foreign law firm or Malaysian law
firm but who may be flying in and out of the country and either directly or
indirectly, does or solicits the right to do any act which is customarily within
the function or responsibility of an advocate and solicitor, including but not
limited to advising on law (whether Malaysian or otherwise).

5. Clause 4 seeks to insert a new Part IVa to liberalise the legal profession
in Malaysia. Generally, the aim of this liberalisation is to develop Malaysia
into an international Islamic financial hub and to expand the work, expertise
and specialisation of the legal profession in Malaysia. The amendment to
Act 166 by inserting this new Part IVa will allow foreign law firms to practise
in Malaysia in the permitted practice areas through an international partnership
or qualified foreign law firm licence. Local law firms will also be able to
employ foreign lawyers subject to certain conditions.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend section 76 of Act 166 primarily to replace the
word “secrecy” with “confidentiality”. The word “secrecy” may not be apt in
keeping with current emphasis on transparency. Confidentiality that is required
to be maintained in this section is confined to deliberations before the Legal
Profession Qualifying Board, the Bar Council, etc., which explains the reason
for the substitution of the words “proceedings or matters” in subsections (2)
and (3).

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend subsection 80(8a) of the Act to enable interests,_
dividends and other accretions of capital arising from the Compensation Fund
to be channelled to a fund established for the purpose of providing legal
aid.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to insert a new section 92a into the Act. The proposed_
new section 92a will subject a registered foreign lawyer to the control of the
Disciplinary Board for the purposes of all disciplinary actions under Part VII
of the Act.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 93 of Act 166. The current provision_
enables the Chairman of the Disciplinary Board to be appointed from
amongst serving or retired judges who shall serve for an indefinite period.
The proposed amendment to subsection (3) seeks to disallow the appointment
of the Chairman from amongst serving judges. The duration of his office is
proposed to be limited to a maximum of three terms or six years. Consequent
upon the proposal that the appointment of Chairman should be made amongst
the retired judges only, subsection (3a) is proposed to be deleted.


-----

30 _Bill_

The tenure of office of other members of the Board is also limited to a

maximum of two terms or four years only. Apart from that, to be consistent
with the threshold requirement for the appointment of the Chairman, it is
proposed that the requirement of not less than fifteen years’ standing for other
members of the Disciplinary Board be reduced to ten years.

The amendment proposed to subsection (4a) will only allow the President

of the Malaysian Bar to preside at any meeting of the Disciplinary Board and
excludes his representative. Sections (4b) and (4c) are redrafted for purposes
of clarity.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 94 of Act 166. The proposed amendment_

to subsection (2) is necessary to be consistent with the proposed amendment
to subsection 100(7) which allows the Disciplinary Board to impose one or
more of the penalties or punishments mentioned therein. The proposed new
subsection (4a) provides that a foreign lawyer registered under section 40j
shall _mutatis mutandis_ be subject to the same control by the Disciplinary
Board as is by virtue of section 94 exercised over an advocate and solicitor
and any foreign lawyer who has been guilty of any misconduct shall be liable
for suspension, for any period not exceeding five years, or revocation of his
registration or reprimanded or censured or ordered to pay a fine, as the case
may be. The proposed amendment to subsection (5) will prohibit a pupil who
is subject to any disciplinary proceeding from proceeding with his petition for
admission for a period of time. The proposed new subsection (6) will include
a person who has completed the prescribed period of pupillage but has yet to
be admitted as an advocate and solicitor.

11. _Clause 10_ seeks to amend section 99 of Act 166. It is proposed through

the new subsection (3a) that the lodging of any complaint against an advocate
and solicitor should be subject to a limitation period of six years from the date
of the accrual of the right of action to lodge the complaint, except for cases
involving fraud. In such instances, the limitation period shall not run until the
complainant has discovered the fraud or could with reasonable diligence have
discovered it. The proposed new subsection (6) provides that for the purpose
of section 99, “legal firm” includes an international partnership or qualified
foreign law licensed under Part IVa.

12. _Clause 11_ seeks to substitute section 100 of Act 166. The present

provisions relating to summary disposal of complaints by the Disciplinary Board
have been modified, redrafted, rearranged and renumbered in this substituted
section for purposes of clarity and consistency. Concurrence of the advocate
and solicitor is a prerequisite before such procedure is adopted.

Fine to be imposed under the summary procedure is proposed to be spelt

out and the award not to exceed five thousand ringgit as proposed in
paragraph (7)(b). It is also proposed that the Disciplinary Board’s power to
order restitution be confined to the limited circumstances as provided for in
subsection (8).


-----

_Legal Profession (Amendment)_ 31

13. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 103 of Act 166 to grant the Disciplinary_

Board the discretion to extend the time for payment of fine or the sum to
be restituted. Payment must be made to the Malaysian Bar instead of the
Disciplinary Board.

14. _Clauses 13_ and _14_ seek to amend sections 103a and 103b of Act 166

respectively. Basically, the proposed amendments are for purposes of clarity,
consistency and to improve the provisions relating to Disciplinary Committee
and inquiry conducted by it.

15. _Clause 15_ seeks to amend section 103c of Act 166, also aimed at

improving the provisions relating to the findings and recommendations of the
Disciplinary Committee.

16. _Clause 16_ seeks to amend section 103d of Act 166. The proposed

amendments also seek to improve the existing provision and to be in line
with other provisions of the proposed Act. It is proposed that the Disciplinary
Board shall record the reason for rejecting the finding or recommendation
of the Disciplinary Committee. As the existing provision only empowers the
Disciplinary Board to impose a greater penalty than that recommended by
the Disciplinary Committee, it is proposed that the Disciplinary Board is also
granted the power to impose a lesser penalty.

17. _Clause 17 seeks to amend section 103e of Act 166 relating to appeals._

Right to appeal, which is still restricted to final orders or decisions of the
Disciplinary Board, is proposed to be extended to any order made under
subsection 94(4). By the proposed deletion of subsection (2), the prohibition
on judicial review against any decision or order of the Disciplinary Board
is removed. Subsection (3) is proposed to be deleted since hearing before
the High Court is before a single Judge. Subsection (8) which relates to the
Disciplinary Board’s right to appear in and address the High Court and the
appellate Courts in any appeal is also proposed to be deleted as it does not
seem appropriate for an adjudicating body to be embroiled into litigation over
its own decision.

18. _Clause 18 seeks to introduce new sections 103ea_ and 103eb into Act 166.

Common challenges to disciplinary proceedings in the form of interlocutory
applications during the course of an inquiry have the tendency of compromising
the complainant’s right to a legal redress. The preservation of the fundamental
right to judicial review through the deletion of subsection 103e(2) in clause 17
needs to be balanced against the interest of the complainant and the public
at large. There is a deep concern that the process of judicial review may be
abused, purely to delay the inquiry or to stop the inquiry from commencing at
all. The new section 103ea is introduced to deal specifically with provisions
relating to domestic challenge procedures. A mechanism is created to balance
the two competing factors in order to ensure the expeditious completion of an
inquiry by the Disciplinary Committee and the Disciplinary Board. It outlines
the various steps to be observed when an objection is raised at any stage of
an inquiry before the two entities. An aggrieved party shall have access to
judicial review over any objection raised only when the Disciplinary Board
made its final order or decision over a complaint.


-----

32 _Bill_

The new section 103eb makes provisions for cost that could be ordered

by the Court if the application or complaint was found to be frivolous and
vexatious by the Disciplinary Board when dismissing the application or the
complaint. This is to deter any party from lodging any baseless or unjustified
complaint, thus causing the members of the legal profession unnecessary
hardship and embarrassment.

19. _Clause 20_ seeks to amend section 107 of Act 166 to provide that

hearing before the High Court shall be before a single Judge, and
to amend subsection (5) to make it consistent with the wordings in
subsection 103e(5).

20. _Clause 21 contains the saving and transitional provisions as to the_

period of office of the Chairman and the members of the Disciplinary Board
who were appointed before the coming into force of the proposed Act. This
_clause also provides for transitional provisions of disciplinary proceedings_
pending before the Disciplinary Board and the disciplinary appeals pursuant to
section 103e before the commencement of the proposed Act.

21. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are

amendments which are minor or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
