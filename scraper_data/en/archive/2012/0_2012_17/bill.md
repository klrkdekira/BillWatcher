EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Penal Code [Act 574] in line with the introduction
of the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012. The amendments
proposed to the Penal Code deal with organized crimes, activities detrimental
to parliamentary democracy, sabotage and espionage.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 4 on the extension of the Code to_
extraterritorial offences. The new Chapter VIB on organized crime has been
added as an extraterritorial offence under the Code and a new paragraph _(d)_
has been inserted to replace the existing paragraph. In the new paragraph (d),
offences committed against property operated or controlled by in whole or in
part by the Government of Malaysia or any State Government or any citizen
of Malaysia or any corporation created by or under the laws of Malaysia
located outside Malaysia shall be considered as committed in Malaysia. This
is an enlargement of criminal jurisdiction from the existing paragraph (d). This
enlargement is consistent with the current position of international law.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to tackle the situation currently faced by the police with_
regard to the mastermind who commands others to carry out criminal acts.
The current position on abetment does not cover those who instruct. In an
organized crime scenario, it is difficult to connect the person who instructs to
the evidence of the crime committed. Thus, the proposed new provision seeks
to make any person who commands another to do a criminal act an abettor.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to clarify section 120A by providing an additional explanation_
on criminal conspiracy.


-----

_Penal Code (Amendment)_ 13

6. _Clause 5 seeks to add a new subsection to section 120B on punishment_
of criminal conspiracy. The new subsection deals with the formula for
the punishment if the offence, the commission of which is the object of
the conspiracy, is a minor offence under the Minor Offences Act 1955

[Act 336].

7. _Clause 6 seeks to introduce thirteen offences into Chapter VI (Offences_
Against the State). Seven of these are new offences, namely activity detrimental to
parliamentary democracy, attempt to commit activity detrimental to parliamentary
democracy, dissemination of information, sabotage, attempt to commit sabotage,
espionage and attempt to commit espionage. However, the proposed sections
124D, 124E, 124F, 124G, 124I and 124J deal with offences which used to be
in the Internal Security Act 1960 [Act 82] but with modifications.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to introduce new definitions into Chapter VI to cater for the_
new offences under clause 6. The new definitions are “activity detrimental to
parliamentary democracy”, “document or publication detrimental to parliamentary
democracy”, “espionage”, “essential services”, “publication”, “sabotage” and
“sensitive information”.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new offence of being a member of a terrorist_
group into Chapter VIA.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new Chapter VIB on organized crime. Two_
new offences are created, namely being a member of an organized criminal
group which carries a sentence of imprisonment of up to five years and assisting
an organized criminal group which carries a sentence of imprisonment of up
to ten years.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.

[PN(U[2])2839]
