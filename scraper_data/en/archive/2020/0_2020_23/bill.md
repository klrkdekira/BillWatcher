EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Windfall Profit Levy Act 1998 (“Act 592”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and the provision on the commencement
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to substitute section 13 of Act 592 to empower
the Minister to remit the whole or any part of the windfall profit levy payable and
to empower the Director General to remit the whole or any part of the penalty
payable under Act 592. The proposed section 13 also provides for the refund
of windfall profit levy or penalty which has been remitted to any person if
the person has paid the windfall profit levy or penalty.

any person who is entitled to a refund of the levy or penalty under section 13
of Act 592 to claim for a refund within one year from the time the overpayment
or erroneous payment occurred, or the entitlement of the refund occurred.
The proposed section 14 also empowers the Director General to reduce or
disallow the refund if the refund will unjustly enrich the person who makes
the claim.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new section_ 14a into Act 592 to provide
that the Director General may refund the windfall profit levy or penalty if
he is satisfied that the person who makes the claim has properly established
the claim. The claim shall be supported by such evidence as required by
the Director General.
