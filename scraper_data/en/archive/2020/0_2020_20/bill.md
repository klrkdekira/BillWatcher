4 _Bill_

The proposed new section 17a seeks to provide that for the purposes of

Act 438, a senior officer of customs shall, in addition to the powers provided
for under Act 438, have all the powers of a police officer of whatever rank
as provided for under the Criminal Procedure Code [Act 593] in relation to

customs shall have all the powers of a police officer of the rank of Corporal
and below and the powers of a prison officer of the rank of Sergeant and
below under the Prison Act 1995 when escorting and guarding any person in
custody. This _clause_ also seeks to confer powers of an officer in charge of a
police station on a proper officer of customs, and for such purpose the office
of the proper officer of customs shall be deemed to be a police station.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 26 of Act 438 by introducing new
subsections (3a) and (3b).

The proposed subsection 26(3a) seeks to empower the officer effecting

the seizure to seal any goods, receptacle, package, baggage, vehicle, vessel
or aircraft, or the premises or place in which the goods, receptacle, package,
baggage, vehicle, vessel or aircraft is found where by reason of its nature,
size or amount it is not practicable to remove the good, receptacle, package,
baggage, vehicle, vessel or aircraft seized.

The proposed subsection 26(3b) seeks to make it an offence for any person

to in subsection (3a) or removes any goods, receptacle, package, baggage,
vehicle, vessel or aircraft under seal, or attempts to do so and to provide
punishments for such offence.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new section_ 30b into Act 438 to provide
for the credibility of an agent provocateur’s evidence and the admissibility

subsequently charged with an offence under this Act.

6. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Explanatory Statement
