4. _Clauses 3, 4_ and 5 seek to amend subsection 27(1), paragraph 31(1)(b)
and subsection 32(2) of Act 806 respectively as consequential amendments
arising from the renumbering of subsection 26(8) as subsection 26(9) and
subsection 26(9) as subsection 26(8) by the Sales Tax (Amendment) Act 2019

[Act A1596].

5. _Clause 6_ seeks to introduce a new section 35a into Act 806.

The proposed subsection 35a(1) seeks to empower the Director General to

direct any registered manufacturer to deduct the amount of refund from the
amount of sales tax to be paid from his return under section 26.

The proposed subsection 35a(2) seeks to provide that where after a registered

manufacturer makes a deduction under the proposed subsection 35a(1), there
is any balance in the amount of the refund, the balance shall be refunded to
the registered manufacturer by the Director General.

The proposed subsection 35a(3) seeks to empower the Director General

to withhold the whole or any part of any amount of refund to be credited to
any following or subsequent taxable period.

6. _Clause 7_ seeks to amend subsection 69(1) of Act 806 to empower the
proper officer of sales tax to make any seizure in any premises.

7. _Clause 8_ seeks to introduce a new section 69a into Act 806.

The proposed subsection 69a(1) seeks to empower the proper officer of sales

tax to seal any goods, documents, articles or things, or the places, premises,
receptacles, packages or conveyances in which the goods, documents, articles
or things are found where by reason of their nature, size or amount it is not
practicable to remove the goods, documents, articles or things seized.

The proposed subsection 69a(2) seeks to make it an offence for any

seal referred to in subsection (1) or removes the goods, documents, articles,
things, receptacles, packages or conveyances under seal, or attempts to do so
and to provide punishments for such offence.
