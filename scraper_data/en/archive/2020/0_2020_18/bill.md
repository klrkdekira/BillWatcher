EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Customs Act 1967 (“Act 235”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and the provision on the commencement
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend subsection 93(1) of Act 235 to provide that
when any goods upon which customs duty has been paid, are re-exported,
the Director General may allow nine-tenths of the duties calculated in accordance
with subsection 93(2) of Act 235 to be repaid as drawback.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend subsection 99(1) of Act 235 to provide for the
minimum amount of a claim of drawback that may be made on the imported
goods upon which customs duty has been paid when the goods are re-exported.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to introduce a new section 106c into Act 235 to provide
that a proper officer of customs shall have all the powers of a police officer
of the rank of Corporal and below and the powers of a prison officer of the
rank of Sergeant and below under the Prison Act 1995 when escorting and
guarding any person in custody. This _clause_ also seeks to confer powers of
an officer in charge of a police station on a proper officer of customs, and
for such purpose the office of the proper officer of customs shall be deemed
to be a police station.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend section 114 of Act 235 by introducing new
subsections (3a) and (3b).

The proposed subsection 114(3a) seeks to empower the seizing officer to

or place in which the goods and such receptacles, packages or conveyances
are found where by reason of their nature, size or amount it is not practicable
to remove the goods and such receptacles, packages or conveyances seized.

The proposed subsection 114(3b) seeks to make it an offence for any

person who without lawful authority, breaks, tampers with or damages the
seal referred to in subsection (3a) or removes any goods and such receptacles,
packages or conveyances under seal, or attempts to do so and to provide
punishments for such offence.

officer of customs or a police officer whatever his rank, by a person who is
subsequently charged with an offence under this Act.

8. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Explanatory Statement
are minor or consequential in nature.

of which cannot at present be ascertained.
