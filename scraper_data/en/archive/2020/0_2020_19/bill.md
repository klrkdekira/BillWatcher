EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Excise Act 1976 (“Act 176”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and the provision on the commencement
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend subsection 19(1) of Act 176 to provide for the
minimum amount of a claim of drawback that may be made on the goods
upon which excise duty has been paid when the goods are exported.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend subsection 19a(1) of Act 176 to provide
that when any imported goods upon which excise duty has been paid, are
re-exported, the Director General may allow nine-tenths of the duties calculated
in accordance with subsection 19a(2) of Act 176 to be repaid as drawback.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to introduce a new section 50b into Act 176 to provide
that a proper officer shall have all the powers of a police officer of the rank
of Corporal and below and the powers of a prison officer of the rank of
Sergeant and below under the Prison Act 1995 when escorting and guarding
any person in custody. This _clause_ also seeks to confer powers of an officer
in charge of a police station on a proper officer, and for such purpose the
office of the proper officer shall be deemed to be a police station.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend section 54 of Act 176 by introducing new
subsections (3a) and (3b).

The proposed subsection 54(3a) seeks to empower the seizing officer to

seal any goods, vehicle, vessel or aircraft, or the premises or place in which
the goods, vehicle, vessel or aircraft is found where by reason of its nature,
size or amount it is not practicable to remove the goods, vehicle, vessel or
aircraft seized.

The proposed subsection 54(3b) seeks to make it an offence for any person

who without lawful authority, breaks, tampers with or damages the seal referred
to in subsection (3a) or removes any goods, vehicle, vessel or aircraft under
seal, or attempts to do so and to provide punishments for such offence.

for the credibility of an agent provocateur’s evidence and the admissibility
as evidence of any statement given to an agent provocateur, whether he is an
officer of excise or a police officer whatever his rank, by a person who is
subsequently charged with an offence under this Act.

8. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Explanatory Statement
are minor or consequential in nature.

of which cannot at present be ascertained.
