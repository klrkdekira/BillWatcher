EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Election Offences Act 1954 ("Act 5").

2. _Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title and contains provisions on the_
commencement of the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 5. It seeks to introduce the
definition of "campaign period" which refers to the period in which a candidate
or his election agent may hold election campaign in his constituency. The
definition of "returning officer" is introduced for the purpose of clarification
only.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 5 relating to electoral offences._
It seeks to introduce two new offences, namely the offence of obstructing or
preventing a voter who is entitled to vote from voting at an election and the
offence of voting in an election at more than one polling station whether in the
same or different constituency. It also seeks to enhance the existing penalty of
a fine of two thousand ringgit to five thousand ringgit.

5. _t[Clause 4][ seeks to amend section 4 of Act 5, primarily to enhance the]_
existing penalty of a fine of two thousand ringgit to five thousand ringgit.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new section 4A into Act 5. The new section_
4A is essentially a restatement of the provisions of paragraph 3(l)(e) of the
Sedition Act 1948, incorporated with a view to preserving racial unity, etc. by
prohibiting categorically any person from doing any act or making any statement
which may create feelings of ill-will, discontent or hostility amongst the population
of Malaysia in his endeavours to procure the election of any person.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 5 of Act 5 in relation to the penalty_
prescribed in subsection (7). The maximum term of imprisonment is now enhanced
to one year from the existing six months while the maximum fine of five
hundred ringgit is enhanced to three thousand ringgit.

8. Clause JO seeks to amend section 11 of Act 5. It proposes to enhance the
penalties which can be imposed for corrupt practices to ensure that the penalties
are commensurate with such offences. The maximum term of imprisonment of
twelve months is now enhanced to two years and the maximum fine of one
thousand ringgit is enhanced to five thousand ringgit. The maximum term of
imprisonment of six months is enhanced to one year while the maximum fine
is enhanced to two thousand ringgit from the existing five hundred ringgit.

9. _Clause 11 seeks to amend subsection 12(6A) of Act 5. This amendment is_
consequential to the amendment made in regulation 4 of the Elections (Conduct
of Elections) Regulations 1981 which requires only a candidate's correspondence
address to be stated in his nomination papers.

10. _Clause 12 -seeks to amend section 14 of Act 5 by rearranging sub-_
section (1) into paragraphs for ease of comprehension and by removing the


-----

_Elections Offences (Amendment)_ 25

existing requirement imposed on the election agent to inform the presiding
officer at each polling station in writing of the names and addresses of his
polling agents and counting agents before polling begins.

A new subsection (!A) is proposed to be introduced into section 14 to impose
a requirement that a polling agent or counting agent must be at a polling station
for a minimum period of two hours. His replacement shall only be admitted to
the polling station on the expiration of that period.

11. _Clause 14 seeks to amend section 19 of Act 5 to increase the expenses_
which a candidate or his election agent may incur at an election. An increase
from fifty thousand ringgit to two hundred thousand ringgit in the case of an
election to the Dewan Rakyat and from thirty thousand ringgit to one hundred
thousand ringgit in the case of an election to a Legislative Assembly is proposed
as the amount provided for at present is considered inadequate and unrealistic.

12. _Clause 15 seeks to amend section 23 of Act 5. The proposed amendment_
seeks to make a candidate also responsible for submitting the return respecting
election expenses to the State Elections Officer. The existing provision imposes
such duty on the candidate's election agent only.

13. _Clause 16 seeks to amend section 24 of Act 5 to increase the fee payable_
for making extract or copies from any return respecting election expenses and
the statements made in respect of such return. The existing fee of two ringgit
is to be increased to ten ringgit, while the existing fee of fifty sen will be
increased to two ringgit.

14. Clause 17 seeks to introduce new sections 24A and 24.B into Act 5.

The new section 24A seeks to spell out various activities that are prohibited
on nomination day with a view to limiting political propaganda on that day.

The new section 24e permits a candidate or his election agent to hold election
campaign during the campaign period and spells out the limitation of such
campaign.

The proposed subsection (2) allows a candidate or his election agent to open,
establish or maintain offices during the campaign period.

By virtue of the proposed subsection (3), a candidate or his election agent
is allowed to hold open public meetings or open public rallies, etc. if he holds
a permit issued to him by the police officer in charge of the district where the
meeting or rally is to be held.

Another important aspect of the proposed new section 24s is with respect
to the display or distribution of election campaign materials. The display or
distribution of such materials is subject to a permit issued by and the payment
of a deposit to the State Elections Officer as provided in subsection (4). Subsection


-----

26 _Bill_

(5) specifies the manner in which the deposit is to be dealt with. Conditions
and restrictions imposed on the display or affixing of election campaign materials
are dealt with in subsections (7) to (9).

Under subsection (10) non-compliance of the proposed subsection (3), (4)
or (7) is an offence.

15. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 25 of Act 5 to enhance the penalty_
imposed under subsection (3). The maximum term of imprisonment is increased
to one year from the existing six months while the maximum fine is increased
to five thousand ringgit from the existing five hundred ringgit. It also seeks to
introduce into the section a new subsection (6) to clarify the intended meaning
of the term "employer".

16. _Clause 19 seeks to replace section 26 of Act 5. The new section 26 spells_
out various acts and activities that are prohibited on polling day.

17. _Clause 20 seeks to amend section 26A to impose a duty on the Election_
Commission to provide booths for the purposes of assisting electors to determine
their electoral numbers in the electoral roll. .

18. _Clause 21 seeks to delete section 26s of Act 5. The deletion seeks to put_
an end to all activities on the canvassing for votes on polling day.

19. _Clause 22 seeks to amend section 27 of Act 5 to enhance the penalty for_
illegal practice at an election from five hundred ringgit to five thousand ringgit.

20. _Clause 23 seeks to redraft section 31 of Act 5 to provide a mechanism_
for the Election Commission to be formally notified of the decision of a Sessions
Court in convicting a candidate of any corrupt or illegal practice at an election.
A new subsection (2) is introduced to require the Sessions Court Judge or
Registrar of the Sessions Court to certify the Court's determination to the
Election Commission within fourteen days of the date of such conviction.

21. _Clause 25 seeks to amend section 35 of Act 5 in respect of reliefs which_
may be claimed in an election petition. With the proposed amendment, a petitioner
cannot make a claim for a declaration that any candidate was duly elected and
ought to have been returned.

22. _Clause 26 seeks to introduce a new section 35A into Act 5 to make it clear_
that the trial of every election petition shall be completed not later than six
months from the date the election petition is presented.

23. _Clause 27 seeks to amend section 36 of Act 5. With the proposed amendment,_
an Election Judge cannot determine any other candidate, except the candidate
whose return or election is complained of, as having been duly returned or
elected.

24. _Clause 28 seeks to introduce new sections 36A, 36s and 36c into Act 5._


-----

_Elections Offences (Amendment)_ 27

The proposed new section 36A provides an avenue for appeal to be presented
to the Federal Court against the determination of an Election Judge and seeks
to outline the procedures in respect thereof.

The proposed new section 36e makes it clear that an appeal against the
determination of an Election Judge shall be completed within six months from
the date the appeal is presented.

The effect of the decision of an Election Judge or the Federal Court is
provided for in the proposed new section 36c. The determination of an Election
Judge if there is no appeal presented to the Federal Court, or the decision of
the Federal Court in the event of an appeal, is final.

25. Clause 29 seeks to amend section 37 of Act 5. This is a consequential
amendment occasioned by the introduction of the provision on appeal against
the determination of an Election Judge. It also seeks to amend subsection (2)
to afford any person who is required to show why he should not be reported
by an Election Judge or Registrar of the Federal Court for corrupt or illegal
practice the right to be represented by counsel.

26. _Clause 31 seeks to amend section 42 of Act 5 to remove any confusion_
relating to the procedure and practice on an election petition. It seeks to clarify
that an election petition shall be regulated by the Election Petition Rules 1954
contained in the Second Schedule to Act 5 and that the High Court Rules 1980
shall apply only in the event of a lacuna or when any matter is not expressly
provided for in the Election Petition Rules 1954.

27. _Clause 33 seeks to amend the Election Petition Rules contained in the_
Second Schedule to Act 5, to make better provisions, to make the necessary
consequential amendments, to delete any provisions which are not necessary
or have outlived their usefulness, to remove any ambiguity in the interpretation
of certain provisions in the Rules and for ease of comprehension. The more
significant amendments are as follows:

_(a) the definition of "Registrar" in rule 2 is expanded to include the_
Deputy Registrar and the Senior Assistant Registrar of the High Court;

_(b) rule 10 is deleted as it imposes a burden on the person who is returned_
in an election;

_(c) rule 12 is amended to provide that the presentation of an election_
petition shall be accompanied by security for the payment of all costs,
_etc. and that no petition shall be registered otherwise;_

_(d) the amount of security in rule 12 is proposed to be increased from_
two thousand ringgit to ten thousand ringgit as the existing amount
is considered inadequate under present circumstances;

_(e) rule 19 is amended to remove the requirement to publish in the_
_Gazette the order made by an Election Judge each time he postpones_
the trial of an election petition;


-----

28 _Bill_

_(f) rule 20 is amended to state categorically that in the event the Judge_
who begins the trial of an election petition becomes disabled by
illness or otherwise, the trial must not be recommenced but must be
continued and concluded by another Judge.

28. Other amendments not specifically referred to in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature or are intended to make the provisions clearer and
more easily comprehended.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
