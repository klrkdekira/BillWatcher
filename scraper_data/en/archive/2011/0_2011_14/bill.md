domestic servants to be made into bank accounts, to provide for the registration
of information relating to the supply of employees by a contractor for labour,
to require information regarding the termination of service of foreign domestic
servant and foreign employees to be submitted and to provide for the inquiry
into complaints of sexual harassment.

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint
the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 265 to introduce new definitions
and to amend certain existing definitions used in Act 265. The definition of
“confinement” is amended to enable a pregnant female employee to enjoy
maternity protections under Act 265 as early as at twenty-two weeks of
pregnancy should the eventualities such as premature births or miscarriages
occur. Amongst the new definitions inserted are the definitions of “contractor
for labour” as the person responsible for supply of employees and the definition
of “sexual harassment” for the purpose of inquiry into complaints of sexual
harassment under the new Part XVa of Act 265.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 4 of Act 265 to include the decisions
or orders made under section 69b, 69c and subsection 81d(4) as decisions
or orders which cannot be appealed to the Director General by any person
affected by such decisions and orders.

5. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 19 of Act 265 to give reasonable period
to the employer to pay to his employees wages for working on a rest day,
gazetted public holiday and during overtime, not later than the last day of the
next wage period.

6. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 22 of Act 265 to extend the application
of this section to allow for payment of advances to be made to the employee
for various purposes such as for payment of daily expenses and other expenses
necessary to support the needs of the employee and his immediate family
members.

7. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 25 of Act 265 to obligate the employer
to make payment of wages to the employee including the domestic servant
through payment into the account of the employee at a bank, finance company,
financial institution or other institutions licensed or established under the
Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 [Act 372] or any other written
law.

8. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 25a of Act 265 to provide for exception_
to section 25 in which the payment of wages to the employee may be made
in legal tender or by cheque provided that there is a written request from the
employee for such mode of payment and in the case of a domestic servant,
the Director General’s approval shall be obtained by the employer.
