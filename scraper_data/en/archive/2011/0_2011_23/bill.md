EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Domestic Violence Act 1994 (“Act 521”).

_2._ _Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint_

the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 521 to introduce new definitions_

and to amend certain existing definitions used in Act 521. Amongst others,
the definition of “domestic violence” is amended to include acts of causing
psychological abuse which includes emotional injury to the victim and causing
the victim to suffer delusions by using any intoxicating substance.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 3 of Act 521 to state specifically that

the provisions of Act 521 are to be read together with the provisions of the
Penal Code or any other written law involving domestic violence.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend the heading of Part II of Act 521 to reflect_

the scope of the matters to which Part II relates.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 521 to specify the mode by_

which an interim protection order may be sought. In making such order, the
court is empowered to include a provision prohibiting the person against
whom the order is made from inciting others to commit domestic violence
against his spouse, former spouse or child or an incapacitated adult or any
other member of his family. The conditions when the interim protection order
shall cease to have effect are also provided in the amendment.

7. _Clause 7_ seeks to amend subsection 6(1) of Act 521 to extend the

ambit of a protection order. With the amendment, a safe place and shelter are
included in the list of where the person against whom the protection order is
made is prohibited or restricted from entering. Also, an order may be made
to prohibit or restrict him from communicating by whatever means with the
protected person.


-----

12 _Bill_

8. _Clause 8_ seeks to amend section 7 of Act 521 to make it compulsory

for the court to attach the warrant of arrest together with the protection order
or interim protection order if the court is satisfied that the person against
whom a protection order or interim protection order is made is likely to cause
actual physical injury to the protected person. It also seeks to specify the
circumstances where a police officer may arrest without warrant the persons
against whom the order is made.

9. _Clause 9_ seeks to amend section 10 of Act 521 to enable a victim of

domestic violence to lay a claim for compensation for psychological abuse
which includes emotional injury suffered.

10. _Clause 10_ seeks to amend section 11 of Act 521 to empower the court

to make an order to refer the parties in the application of a protection order
to a conciliatory body. It also seeks to set out the role of a conciliatory body
in recommending parties referred to it by the court to undergo appropriate
therapy or counselling.

11. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend the heading of Part IV of Act 521 to reflect

the scope of the matter to which the Part relates.

12. _Clause 12_ seeks to introduce new sections 12a and 12b into Act 521.

Section 12a states that the applications for interim protection orders shall be made
_ex parte and section 12b relates to setting aside of the order obtained._

13. _Clause 13_ seeks to substitute section 14 of Act 521 to allow an

application for a protection order or an interim protection to be filed in any
court irrespective of the territorial jurisdiction of the court so as to facilitate
the applicant in seeking legal redress. In this respect, the court is requested
to hear the application as soon as practicable.

14. _Clause 16_ seeks to amend section 17 of Act 521 to allow any other

police officers under the command of the officer in charge of a police district
where the offender resides other than the officer in charge of a police district
himself to serve a copy of such order to the offender. It also seeks to allow
the court to be flexible in designating any court officials and not necessarily
the Registrar to issue such order as provided for in the existing section 17
of Act 521. This amendment facilitates better service of the protection order
and filing of proof of service of the order with the court by the police.

15. _Clause 17 seeks to introduce a new section 17a into Act 521 to allow for_

the service of any interim protection orders or protection orders by substituted
service.

16. _Clause 18_ seeks to introduce a new section 18a into Act 521 to provide

that a domestic violence offence shall be deemed to be a seizable offence.

18. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor

and consequential in nature.
