proposed Act.


-----

6 _Bill_

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 227 to include a provision to_
allow the computation of retirement benefit of a retired officer on the ground
of national interest or in the interest of the public service to be calculated
according to the period of reckonable service as if the officer had served until
the age of compulsory retirement which applies to him.

4. _Clauses 3,_ _6 and 10 seek to amend sections_ 6a, 12a and 23 of Act
227 respectively which are consequential to the proposed extension of the
compulsory age of retirement to sixty years as amended in clause 4. However,
such officers are given an option to retire at the present compulsory age of
retirement of either fifty-five, fifty-six or fifty-eight years before 1 January
2012.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend the age at which pension may begin to be paid_
to an officer appointed in service on or after 12 April 1991 who has optionally
retired, namely from the compulsory age of retirement of fifty-five years,
fifty-six years or fifty-eight years whichever is applicable to the officer, to
fifty-five years of age.

6. _Clauses 7 and 11 seek to amend sections 15 and 25 of Act 227 respectively_
regarding the extension of the grant of derivative pension and derivative
retiring allowance from twelve and a half years to twenty years from the date
of retirement of an officer to persons prescribed in the regulations, other than
those specified in the proviso to sections 15 and 25 of Act 227.

7. _Clauses 8 and 9 seek to amend sections 19 and 20 of Act 227 respectively_
to enable the grant of pension, derivative pension, gratuity or other benefit
to be made ​to an officer, a pensioner or a recipient of derivative pension
who is a bankrupt. For that purpose, the deletion of section 20 of Act 227 is
proposed in _clause 9. However, for the discharge of the court order issued in_
relation to bankruptcy matters under any written law relating to bankruptcy,
amendment to section 19 of Act 227 is also made in _clause 8 to enable the_
pension, derivative pension, gratuity or other benefit provided to be assignable,
transferable, liable to be attached, sequestered or levied.

8. _Clause 12 deals with savings and transitional provision._

9. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential amendments.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
