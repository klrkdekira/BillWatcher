EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act
2010 (“Act A1378”).

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act A1378. The amendments are
necessary to ensure the smooth implementation of the pre-trial processes
introduced by Act A1378.

General amendments are introduced into sections 172A, 172B and 172C to
make it clear that the pre-trial conference, case management and plea bargaining
are available to an accused who claims to be tried.

The amendments to section 172B seek to clarify that exhibits can be admitted
and marked by the Court at the case management stage with the consent of the
parties. The amendments also seek to provide that the failure of the Court to
commence the case management process or the trial within the time stipulated
in section 172B shall not render the charge and prosecution against the accused
as defective or invalid, nor shall such failure be considered as a ground for
appeal, review or revision. This amendment is necessary to make clear that
the intention in introducing the time periods under this proposed section is to
overcome the backlog in criminal courts and to promote expeditious disposal
of criminal cases and that it was never the intention allow the provision to
be misused to invalidate the charge, prosecution or merits of the case.

The amendments to section 172D seek to provide some exceptions to the
lighter sentence that the Court may impose upon a satisfactory disposition
of a plea bargaining of sentence. Offenders who commit offences which the
punishment provided under the law is a fine only or imprisonment for natural
life, who commit sexual related offences, who commit offences against children
below the age of twelve years, or who commit any other offence as may be
specified by the Public Prosecutor by order published in the _Gazette are not_
entitled to the lighter sentence. Offenders who have previous convictions in
relation to a serious offence are also not entitled to the lighter sentence. The
amendment also makes it clear that the plea bargaining of sentence is only
in respect of the punishment of imprisonment.

A new section 172G is introduced into section 2 of Act A1378 to enable
an accused who pleads guilty at any time before the commencement of his
trial to be sentenced by the Court in accordance with section 172D even if
the accused did not make an application for plea bargaining.

4. Clauses 3 and 4 seek to amend sections 3 and 5 of Act A1378 respectively.
The Court shall, upon the request of the victim of the offence or his family,
call upon the victim or a member of his family to make a statement on the
impact of the offence on the victim or his family. The amendment also seeks
to allow the Court to accept a written statement from a victim or a member


-----

_Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)_ 9
_Act 2010 (Amendment)_

of his family where the victim or a member of his family is unable for any
reason to attend the proceedings upon being called by the Court to give such
impact statement. This amendment seeks to safeguard the interest of the victim
and his family.

5. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 7 of Act A1378 to clarify that the notice
of alibi to be given to the Public Prosecutor must be in writing.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 9 of Act A1378 to amend section 407A.
The amendment to subsection 407A(1) seeks to remove the time limit within
which the Public Prosecutor has to apply to the Court for the disposal of the
articles referred to in subsection 407A(2). With this amendment, the Public
Prosecutor may at any time make an application to the Court. The amendment
to subsection 407A(3) takes into consideration that there are already sufficient
safeguards provided in the proposed section to ensure the authenticity of the
articles in question. An additional safeguard is provided in the new subsection
407A(4) where the Court has the discretion to allow the accused to take
photographs of the articles before the articles are disposed of.

7. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 11 of Act A1378 to amend subsection
426(1) to provide for prosecution cost to be paid by the convicted accused
upon the application of the Public Prosecutor where the prosecution of the
convicted accused involves evidence obtained pursuant to a request made under
the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 2002 [Act 621] or where the
accused is convicted of an offence where he has obtained pecuniary gain. The
sum of the prosecution cost shall be fixed by the Court as may be agreed by
the Public Prosecutor.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
