EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Housing Development (Control and Licensing)
Act 1966 (“Act 118”) to tighten the regulations on the carrying out of a
housing development and to protect the purchasers.

2. _Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title, date of commencement and_
application of the proposed Act.


-----

6 _Bill_

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend the definition of the term “housing developer”_
in section 3 of Act 118 to include the liquidator so that the obligations of the
wound-up housing developer will be fulfilled by the liquidator.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 118 in respect of the sum of_
deposit for obtaining a housing development licence from the current two
hundred thousand ringgit to three per cent of the estimated cost of construction.
The proposed amendment is to ensure that only licensed housing developers
with sufficient financial capability are allowed to undertake any housing
development.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 7B of Act 118 to ensure that any licensed_
housing developer whose licence has expired will still be caught by section 7
of Act 118.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to substitute section 8A of Act 118 to confer to the purchaser_
the right to terminate the sale and purchase agreement if the licensed housing
developer refuses to carry out or delays or suspends or ceases work for a
continuous period of six months or more after the execution of the sale and
purchase agreement.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend subsection 16N(1) of Act 118 in relation to_
the limitation of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal because the meaning of the
words “any chose of action” could be misinterpreted as including a claim on
any liquidated damages under the sale and purchase agreement. Clause 6 also
seeks to amend subsection 16N(2) of Act 118 to extend the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal to hear a claim that is based on a cause of action arising from a sale
and purchase agreement involving an unlicensed housing developer.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend the shoulder note of section 16Q of Act 118 to_
clarify the application of the section.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 16AD of Act 118 to increase the minimum_
penalty of non-compliance with the Tribunal’s award to ten thousand ringgit
and the maximum penalty to fifty thousand ringgit.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new section 18A into Act 118 to make_
it an offence for any licensed housing developer who abandons a housing
development to prevent the occurrence of abandoned housing development
and to enable a criminal proceeding to be taken against licensed housing
developers who abandon a housing development.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 24 to increase the penalty for any_
act or omission in contravention of any of the regulations from a fine not
exceeding twenty thousand ringgit to fifty thousand ringgit.

12. _Clause 11 contains savings and transitional provision._

13. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.
