EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Statutory And Local Authorities Pensions Act
1980 (“Act 239”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the commencement date of the_
proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 5 of Act 239 to include a provision_
to allow the computation of retirement benefit of a retired employee on the
ground of national interest or in the interest of the service of the statutory or
local authority to be calculated according to the period of reckonable service
as if the employee had served until the age of compulsory retirement which
applies to him.


-----

6 _Bill_

4. _Clauses 3,_ _6 and 10 seek to amend sections 6A, 13 and 26 of Act 239_
respectively which are consequential to the proposed extension of the compulsory
age of retirement to sixty years as amended in clause 4. However, employees
are given an option to retire at the present compulsory age of retirement
of either fifty-five, fifty-six or fifty-eight years applicable to them before
1 January 2012.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend the age at which pension may begin to be_
paid to an employee appointed in service on or after 12 April 1991 who has
optionally retired, namely from the compulsory age of retirement of fiftyfive years, fifty-six years or fifty-eight years whichever is applicable to the
employee, to fifty-five years of age.

6. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 16 of Act 239 regarding the extension of_
the grant of derivative pension and derivative retiring allowance from twelve
and a half years to twenty years from the date of retirement of an employee
to persons prescribed in the regulations, other than those specified in the
proviso to section 16 of Act 239.

7. _Clauses 8 and 9 seek to amend sections 21 and 22 of Act 239 respectively_
to enable the grant of pension, derivative pension, gratuity or other benefit
to be made to an employee, a pensioner or a recipient of derivative pension
who is a bankrupt. For that purpose, the deletion of section 22 of Act 239 is
proposed in _clause 9. However, for the discharge of the court order issued in_
relation to bankruptcy matters under any written law relating to bankruptcy,
amendment to section 21 of Act 239 is also made in _clause 8 to enable the_
pension, derivative pension, gratuity or other benefit provided to be assignable,
transferable, liable to be attached, sequestered or levied.

8. _Clause 11 deals with savings and transitional provision._

9. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential amendments.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
