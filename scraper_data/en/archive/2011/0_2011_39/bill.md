EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (“Act 593”).

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 51A of Act 593 to make it clear that
the documents to be tendered by the prosecution under subsection 51A(1) are
admissible in evidence notwithstanding that the prosecution did not deliver the
documents to the accused before the commencement of the trial. Where the
delivery of the documents to the accused was done after the commencement
of the trial, the Court shall allow the accused a reasonable time period to
examine the documents and shall allow the accused to recall or re-summon and
examine any witness in relation to that document. Also, as a further safeguard
in the interest of the accused, the Court may exclude any document delivered
after the commencement of the trial if it is shown that such delivery was so
done deliberately and in bad faith.

4. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 283 of Act 593 to provide for a more
reasonable scale of imprisonment for default of payment of fine which the
Court may impose on the offender.


-----

_Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)_ 5

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 396 of Act 593 to allow the Court on the_
application of the Public Prosecutor, to record the evidence of a person whose
attendance in the Court as a witness cannot be procured without unreasonable
delay or expense or who may become incapable to give evidence. The evidence
of such person shall be recorded on oath by the Court and the person shall be
examined in accordance with the Evidence Act 1950 during the recording of
evidence. With this amendment, there is no longer a requirement to commit
a person to the civil prison until the trial or to require the person to give
satisfactory security that he will give evidence at the trial.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.

[PN(U[2])2805]
