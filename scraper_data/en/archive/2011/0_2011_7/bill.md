and immunities of the United Nations and Specialized Agencies.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act._


-----

48 _Bill_

3. _Clause 2 seeks to provide for the application of the Convention on the_
Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and the Convention on the
Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies respectively.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 485, amongst others to introduce_
the definitions of “diplomatic agent” and “United Nations”.

5. _Clause 4 seeks amend section 3 to allow the Minister to declare another_
category of organization to be an international organization if the said
organization performs functions that are beneficial to Malaysia. This _clause_
also provides that such category excludes certain organizations, namely, where
an organization is incorporated or established in Malaysia or for a commercial
purpose.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 4 to provide for the extent of privileges_
and immunities of a high officer or an officer of an international organization
who is a Malaysian citizen.

7. _Clause 6_ seeks to insert new sections 6a and 6b into Act 485. The

Minister to confer such privileges and immunities according to the Convention

such privileges and immunities are not granted for personal benefit and can
be waived without prejudicing the interests of the international organizations
and overseas organizations, if they impede the course of justice.

485 pursuant to the insertion of sections 6a and 6b.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to amend the First Schedule to Act 485 to extend the_
immunity of inviolability to documents.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend Part I of the Second, Third and Fifth Schedules_
to Act 485 respectively by substituting for the words “head of mission” the
words “diplomatic agent”.

12. _Clause 11 seeks to introduce the Seventh and Eighth Schedules into Act_
485 which specify the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the
United Nations and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the
Specialized Agencies respectively.
