EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The proposed Peaceful Assembly Act 2011 (“the proposed Act”) relates to the

deemed necessary or expedient relating to such right in the interest of the
security of the Federation or any part thereof or public order, including the
protection of the rights and freedoms of other persons, and to provide for related
matters. The proposed Act is one of the efforts initiated by the Government
to undertake the transformation of the existing legal framework in relation to
the constitutional rights of citizens to assemble.

PART I

2. Part I of the proposed Act contains preliminary matters.

_Clause 1 contains the short title and the provisions on commencement and_
the non-application of the proposed Act. The short title reflects the scheme
of the proposed Act which is to affirm the right to assemble peaceably and
without arms.

_Clause 2 contains the objects of the proposed Act. This_ _clause clarifies_
the overall purpose of the proposed Act that is to allow citizens to organize
assemblies and participate in assemblies peaceably and without arms subject
only to restrictions deemed necessary or expedient in the interest of the
security of the Federation or any part thereof or public order, including the
protection of the rights and freedoms of other persons. The expression “rights
and freedoms of other persons” refers to the right to peaceful enjoyment of
one’s possession, the right to freedom of movement, the right to enjoy the
natural environment and the right to carry on business.

_Clause 3_ contains the definitions of the words and expressions used in the
proposed Act. Amongst the definitions provided are “assembly” which includes

this _clause commits an offence._

to advise the organizer on the assembly if the circumstances warrant it.

_Clause 14 requires the Officer in Charge of the Police District to respond to_
a notification of assembly within twelve days of the receipt of the notification.

22 _Bill_

The restrictions and conditions imposed under this clause may, among others,
relate to the date, time and duration of assembly, the place of assembly, the
manner of the assembly, the conduct of participants during the assembly, the
payment of clean-up costs arising out of the holding of the assembly, the
concerns and objections of persons who have interests or any other matters
the Officer in Charge of the Police District deems necessary or expedient in
relation to the assembly. Any person who contravenes the restrictions and
conditions imposed commits an offence.

_Clause 16 provides for the right of appeal on the restrictions and conditions_
imposed. The organizer aggrieved by the imposition of restrictions and conditions
may, within four days of being informed of the restrictions and conditions,
appeal to the Minister who shall give his decision within six days from the
day the appeal was received by him.

_Clause 17_ deals with simultaneous assemblies. If the Officer in Charge
of a Police District receives notifications for two or more assemblies to be
organized, and the assemblies are proposed to be held at the same time, date
and place, the assemblies may, subject to restrictions and conditions imposed
under _clause 15, be held simultaneously. If, in the opinion of the Officer in_
Charge of the Police District, that the assemblies cannot be held simultaneously,
the organizer who first submitted the notification to hold the assembly in the
place of assembly shall be given priority, unless the place of assembly is
traditionally or contractually to be used for the other assembly. In the case
of notifications of assembly received at the same time, the Officer in Charge
of the Police District shall give preference to the organizer whose name is
extracted in a draw.

_Clause 18_ deals with counter assembly. If the Officer in Charge of a
Police District receives a notification of a counter assembly and it is evident
that the organization of the counter assembly will cause conflict between the
participants of the assemblies, the Officer in Charge of the Police District
shall give an alternative for the counter assembly to be organized at another
time, date or place.

_Clause 19 provides for presumption as to the organizer of an assembly held_
at a designated place of assembly, an assembly specified in Third Schedule,
an assembly of which no notification was given as required, or an assembly
of which the identity of the organizer stated in the required notification is
false. Any person who initiates, leads, promotes, sponsors, holds or supervises
the assembly, or invites or recruits participants or speakers for the assembly,
shall be deemed to be the organizer of the assembly.

PART V

6. Part V deals with provisions on enforcement.

_Clause 20_ empowers a police officer to arrest, without warrant, any
organizer or participant who refuses or fails to comply with any restrictions
and conditions under _clause 15,_ any organizer or participant who has in his
possession any arms, or any organizer or participant who recruits or brings a
child, during the assembly. This power is to be exercised only after the police
officer has taken necessary measures to ensure voluntary compliance by the
organizer or participant.


-----

_Peaceful Assembly_ 23

_Clause 21_ empowers a police officer to issue an order to disperse where
the assembly is held at a prohibited place or within fifty metres from the
limit of the prohibited place, the assembly is or has become a street protest,
the participants did not or do not comply with the restrictions and conditions
imposed under _clause 15_ or where the participants are engaging in, or about
to engage in, unlawful or disorderly conduct or violence towards persons or
property. The police officer, in exercising the power to disperse an assembly
under this _clause, is empowered to use all reasonable force. Any person who_
fails to comply with an order of the police officer commits an offence.

PART VI

7. Part VI deals with miscellaneous matters.

Under clause 22, the Officer in Charge of a Police District shall maintain

_Clause 24_ allows any media representative to have reasonable access to a
place of assembly and use any equipment to report on the assembly.

_Clause 25 empowers the Minister to designate any place to be a designated_
place of assembly by notification in the _Gazette. The provision also seeks_
to make clear that the organizer and participant of an assembly held at a
designated place of assembly have the same responsibilities of an organizer
and a participant under _clauses 6 and_ _7._

_Clause 26 empowers the Minister to amend the Schedules by order published_
in the _Gazette._
