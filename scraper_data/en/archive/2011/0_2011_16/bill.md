EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This National Wages Consultative Council Bill 2011 (“the proposed Act”) seeks
to replace the Wages Council Act 1947 [Act 195] and to establish a National
Wages Consultative Council (“the Council”) with the responsibility to conduct
studies on all matters concerning minimum wages and to make recommendation
to the Government to make minimum wages order according to sectors, types
of employment and regional areas, and to provide for related matters.

At present, Act 195 is only applicable with respect to the minimum wages
if the Minister is of the opinion that no adequate machinery exists for the
effective regulation of the remuneration or conditions of employment of the
employee. The difficulties faced in the implementation of Act 195 has led
to the establishment of the Council which aims to assist the Government
in determining the minimum wages rates and coverage before making the
minimum wages order.

The proposed Act also seeks to provide more enforcement powers to ensure
compliance of the minimum wages order by employers in order to protect the
interest of the employees to whom the minimum wages order is applicable.
