limited liability partnership shall be deemed to have continued
in existence as if it had not been dissolved.

or document in carrying out the administrative action under

avail himself of that claim, right or remedy without such approval
or concurrence.

in which the Registrar may deal with the property vested under

credit.


-----

50 _Bill_

used—

_(a)_ if the making of the statement appears to the court to have
been caused by an inducement, threat or promise having
reference to the charge against such person proceeding

of the court to give the person charged grounds which
would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by
making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any
evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings
against him; or

_(b)_ in the case of a statement made by the person after his
arrest, unless the court is satisfied that he was cautioned

say anything or to answer any question, but anything
you say, whether in answer to a question or not, may
be given in evidence.”.

soon as possible after that.

the case after any caution as referred to in paragraph (2)(b) has
