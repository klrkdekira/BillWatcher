relating to a licence for convening or collecting any assembly
or forming any procession under section 27 pending before the

for any assembly and procession to be convened, collected or

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Police Act 1967 (“Act 344”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 21 of Act 344 in consequence of the_
deletion of section 27.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to delete sections 27, 27a, 27b and 27c of Act 344 in_
consequence of the enactment of the proposed Peaceful Assembly Act 2011

assembly or meeting or to form a procession in any public place.

5. _Clause 4 contains the effect of deletion of sections 27, 27a and 27b of_
Act 344.
