_Money Services Business_ 81

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill (“the proposed Act”) seeks to govern the activities of money-changing
business, remittance business and wholesale currency business, which is being
modernised and consolidated into a single industry known as the “money
services business” industry. The proposed Act covers the licensing, regulation
and supervision of licensees and their agents to ensure that the industry shall
comprise of dynamic, competent and professional players. Apart from seeking to
impose governance, operational and control requirements for the sound conduct
of their business, the proposed Act also seeks to strengthen the prudential and
supervisory framework in the money services business industry to curb illegal
activities, money laundering and terrorism financing. This is pertinent for the
maintenance of the integrity of the Malaysian financial system.

At present, the money-changing business is governed by the Money-Changing
Act 1998 [Act 577] which will be repealed by the proposed Act. The remittance
business is currently governed by both the Exchange Control Act 1953

[Act 17] and the Payment Systems Act 2003 [Act 627]. The Exchange Control
Act 1953 also presently governs the wholesale currency business. To give full
effect to the proposed Act, the licensees of the money services business will
be exempted from all current governing laws, and in addition the MoneyChanging Act 1998 will be repealed. Authorized dealers who are licensed banks
and licensed Islamic banks and regulated under the Banking and Financial
Institutions Act 1989 [Act 372] and the Islamic Banking Act 1983 [Act 276],
respectively, are not subject to the proposed Act.

PART I

2. Part I of the proposed Act deals with preliminary matters.

Minister to appoint the date of commencement of the proposed Act. This

in the proposed Act. In particular, this _clause defines and clarifies the type_
of businesses that fall under the definition of “money services business”.
