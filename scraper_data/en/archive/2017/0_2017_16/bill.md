EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Prevention of Crime Act 1959 (“Act 297”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the provision on the commencement_
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to introduce a new section 4a into Act 297 to require_
the submission of a complete report of investigation of a person arrested
under subsection 3(1). The complete report must be submitted to an
Inquiry Officer and the Board within the period to be prescribed by the
Minister in the regulations.


-----

_Prevention of Crime (Amendment)_ 9

4. _Clause 3 seeks to delete section 6 of Act 297. With the deletion of section 6,_
a person remanded under section 4 is brought before an Inquiry Officer only
for the purpose of an inquiry under section 9.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 7a of Act 297._ _Subclauses 4(a) and_ _(b)_
seek to amend subsections 7a(2) and (5) of Act 297 to clarify that the terms
and conditions of an electronic monitoring device to be explained by a
Sessions Court Judge refers to the terms and conditions as stipulated in the
form as specified in the Third Schedule of Act 297. _Subclause 4(c) seeks to_
substitute subsection 7a(7) of Act 297 to include as an offence the act of
damaging and losing an electronic monitoring device and any other device
used in relation to the operation of the electronic monitoring device. This
amendment also empowers the court to impose terms of imprisonment on
a person who defaults his payment for the damage or loss of an electronic
monitoring device and any other device used in relation to the operation of
the electronic monitoring device.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 7b of Act 297 to enable members of the_
Board to be re-appointed for any period. Before the amendment, members of
the Board may be re-appointed only once for another period of three years.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 9 of Act 297 as a consequence to the_
deletion of section 6 of Act 297.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 10 of Act 297._ _Subclause 7(a) seeks to_
amend subsections 10(1) and (2) of Act 297 to remove the requirement for
service of the finding by an Inquiry Officer to the person who was the subject
of an inquiry. The removal of such requirement is in line with the provision
of other preventive laws such as the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive
Measures) Act 1985 [Act 316] and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2015

[Act 769]. Subclause 7(b) seeks to delete subsections 10(3) and (4) of Act 297
as a consequence to the introduction of a new section 10a into Act 297.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section 10a into Act 297 dealing with_
new provisions relating to decision of the Board. Currently, section 11 of
Act 297 provides that the Board may review a finding of an Inquiry Officer or
review a decision by the Board that there are reasonable grounds for believing
that the person who was the subject of an inquiry is a member of any of
the registrable categories. Under the proposed section 10a, the Board has
the power to consider and decide on all findings of an Inquiry Officer. The
removal of the review provision will also result in the removal of the role of
a law officer in advising the Board where an application is made for review
under section 11 of Act 297.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to delete section 11 of Act 297 which has been replaced_
by the introduction of the new section 10a in _clause 8._

11. _Clause 10_ seeks to amend section 12 of Act 297 consequential to the
amendment of section 10 and the deletion of section 11. Through this amendment,
the Registrar shall only register a person’s name in the Register after the Board
has decided that the person is a member of any of the registrable categories.


-----

10 _Bill_

12. _Clause 11 seeks to renumber the existing section 15a of Act 297 as_
section 15b, and to introduce a new section 15a before section 15b as renumbered.
The new section 15a provides for special procedures relating to electronic
monitoring device by order of the Board made under paragraph 15(2)(l). The
police shall explain to the registered person the terms and conditions of the
electronic monitoring device as stipulated in the form specified in the new
Fourth Schedule. Any person who tampers with, damages, destroys or loses
an electronic monitoring device and any other device used in relation to the
operation of the electronic monitoring device commits an offence and the
court may impose terms of imprisonment on a person who defaults payment
for the damage to or loss of an electronic monitoring device and any other
device used in relation to the operation of the electronic monitoring device.

13. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 19a of Act 297._ _Subclause 12(a)_
seeks to amend subsection 19a(1) of Act 297 consequential to the deletion
of section 11. _Subclause 12(b) seeks to delete subsection 19a(2) of Act 297_
as the provision relating to review by the High Court has been clarified in
the new paragraph 15a(2)(ba). Paragraph 15a(2)(ba) provides that judicial
review includes proceedings instituted by way of writ of _habeas corpus._

14. _Clause 13 seeks to amend subparagraph 19b(a)(i) of Act 297 to provide_
that a detention order made under subsection 19a(3) against a person shall not
be invalidated or inoperative by reason that, immediately after the detention
order is made, that person was detained in a place other than the place stated
in the detention order.

15. _Clause 14_ seeks to introduce a new section 19h into Act 297 to give
express power to the Board to revoke the supervision order, detention order,
suspension of detention order or direction for the extension of such orders.

16. _Clause 15 seeks to amend paragraph 21(3)(a) of Act 297 as a consequence_
to the deletion of subsection 10(3) in _subclause 7(b), the introduction of the_
new section 10a in clause 8 and the deletion of section 11 in clause 9 whereby
a remanded person is no longer released under section 10 or 11 but under the
new section 10a.

17. _Clause 16 seeks to introduce a new Fourth Schedule into Act 297 as a_
consequence to the insertion of the new section 15a. The new Fourth Schedule
contains the form to be signed by the person who is ordered by the Board to
be attached with an electronic monitoring device.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
