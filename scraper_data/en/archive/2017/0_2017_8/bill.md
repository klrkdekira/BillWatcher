EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Consumer Protection Act 1999 (“Act 599”). The
main purposes of the amendment are to protect the interest of consumers who
purchase goods through credit sale transactions and to reduce the household
debt which is contributed by credit sale transactions. This amendment also
seeks to strengthen the enforcement powers under Act 599.

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 3 of Act 599 by deleting the definition
of “credit instrument”.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to introduce a new Part IIIb into Act 599 which deals_
with credit sale transactions.

The proposed section 24k seeks to provide for the application and

non-application of the proposed Part IIIb.

The proposed section 24l seeks to provide for the definitions of “total

outstanding amount payable”, “goods”, “terms charges”, “credit facility”,
“credit facility provider”, “dealer”, “seller”, “credit sale agreement”, “statutory
rebate” and “credit sale transaction” used in the proposed Part IIIb.


-----

30 _Bill_

The proposed section 24m seeks to provide that a credit sale agreement

may only be made in respect of any goods or class of goods as prescribed
by the Minister.

The proposed section 24n seeks to provide for the preconditions of a credit

sale agreement. Among others, the proposed section 24n requires, before a
credit sale agreement is entered into between a purchaser and a credit facility
provider, a written statement relating to the summary of financial obligation
of the prospective purchaser and a written statement relating to the consent
of the credit facility provider to provide credit facility to the prospective
purchaser to be served personally on the prospective purchaser.

The proposed section 24n also provides for a cooling-off period of ten

working days before a credit sale agreement may be entered. Notwithstanding
the cooling-off period, the prospective purchaser may elect to enter into a
credit sale agreement after three working days from the date of service of the
written statement relating to the consent of the credit facility provider. The
cooling-off period of ten and three working days will give the prospective
purchaser a reasonable time to consider the purchase of the goods. A credit
sale agreement entered into in contravention of these preconditions shall be
void and any credit facility provider who enters into a credit sale agreement
in contravention of these preconditions commits an offence under Act 599.

The proposed section 24o seeks to require a credit sale agreement to be

made in writing and either in the national language or English language. A
credit sale agreement which contravenes these requirements shall be void.
Contravention of these requirements also constitutes an offence under Act 599.

The proposed section 24p seeks to require a credit sale agreement to contain

certain information which shall include the number of monthly instalments to be
paid, rights and obligations of the purchaser and credit facility provider, terms
charges, total amount payable, etc. A credit sale agreement which contravenes
this provision shall be void and contravention of this requirement constitutes
an offence under Act 599.

The proposed section 24q seeks to provide that the ownership in the

purchased goods shall pass to the purchaser upon the signing of the credit
sale agreement.

The proposed section 24r seeks to provide for the rights and obligations

of a purchaser under a credit sale agreement. Among others, the purchaser is
entitled to an implied guarantee that he shall have and enjoy quiet possession
of the purchased goods and the purchaser has the obligation to inform the
credit facility provider in writing where the purchased goods are kept or used,
or if the goods are not in his possession, to whom he has delivered the goods
or the circumstances under which he has lost possession of the goods.

The proposed section 24s seeks to provide for the rights and obligations of a

credit facility provider under a credit sale agreement. Among others, the credit
facility provider is entitled to cause the purchased goods to be insured in the
name of the purchaser against any risk that the credit facility provider thinks
fit and to collect any booking fee or deposit from the purchaser. The credit


-----

_Consumer Protection (Amendment)_ 31

facility provider has the obligation, among others, to supply to the purchaser,
within the period of twenty-one days from the date of receipt by the credit
facility provider a request in writing from the purchaser, a statement which
contains certain particulars including the total amount paid by the purchaser,
the amount which is to become payable under the agreement and the amount
derived from the term charges on overdue instalments. Failure to discharge
the obligations under the proposed section 24s constitutes an offence under
Act 599.

The proposed section 24t seeks to require that the rate of the terms charges

in respect of any goods or class of goods under a credit sale agreement as
calculated in accordance with the prescribed formula shall not exceed the rate
as prescribed by the Minister. Failure to comply with this provision constitutes
an offence under Act 599. The proposed section 24t also seeks to provide that
if a credit sale agreement is entered into in contravention of the requirement,
the purchaser may elect to treat the agreement as void or to have the excess
amount reduced from the total amount of the terms charges payable if such
terms charges exceed the prescribe rate. The proposed section 24t also provides
for the procedures to be followed after the purchaser makes the election.

The proposed section 24u seeks to limit the period of payment of instalments

which shall not exceed the period as prescribed by the Minister, and to limit
the rate of late payment charges which shall not exceed the rate as prescribed
by the Minister. Failure to comply with these provisions constitutes an offence
under Act 599.

The proposed section 24v seeks to deal with default in payment of instalments

by a purchaser. Upon receipt of a notice from a credit facility provider that
a purchaser has defaulted in payment of two consecutive instalments, the
purchaser may within twenty-one days elect to pay the overdue instalment
and the late payment charges to the credit facility provider, to make an early
settlement, or to terminate the credit facility agreement and surrender the
purchased goods to the credit facility provider.

The proposed section 24w seeks to allow the purchaser, at any time or

upon making the election to terminate a credit sale agreement, to surrender the
purchased goods to the credit facility provider. For the purpose of surrendering
the purchased goods, the proposed section 24w also provides for the procedures
to be followed by the purchaser and the credit facility provider.

The proposed section 24x seeks to restrict a credit facility provider from

disclosing or circulating the personal data of a purchaser obtained under a
credit sale transaction to a third party unless the purchaser has been informed
of the purpose of such disclosure or circulation and a written consent of the
purchaser has been obtained.

The proposed section 24y seeks to prohibit a credit facility provider from

repossessing the purchased goods from a purchaser at any time, whether upon
default of payment of instalments or otherwise.

The proposed section 24z seeks to provide that any contravention against

the proposed section 24x or 24y constitutes an offence.


-----

32 _Bill_

The proposed section 24aa seeks to empower the Minister to make regulations

in respect of credit sale transactions and credit sale agreements.

5. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 123 of Act 599 to provide that an
Assistant Controller investigating any commission of an offence under
Act 599 may exercise all or any of the powers in relation to police investigation
in seizable cases provided by the Criminal Procedure Code.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to introduce a new section 123a into Act 599 to provide
for the power of an Assistant Controller to conduct an investigation on any
person who has committed or is committing any offence upon receiving a
complaint from a person.

7. _Clause 6_ seeks to introduce new sections 124a, 124b, 124c, 124d and
124e into Act 599.

The proposed section 124a seeks to empower the Assistant Controller to

direct any person to provide any information or document, or to appear before
the Assistant Controller, if he has reason to believe that such information or
document is relevant to the performance of the Assistant Controller’s powers
and functions under Act 599. Any refusal or failure to comply with such
direction made by the Assistant Controller constitutes an offence.

The proposed section 124b seeks to empower an Assistant Controller to

take and retain possession of any document obtained under Act 599.

The proposed section 124c seeks to empower an Assistant Controller to

direct any person to allow the Assistant Controller to have access to his books,
records, documents, things or matters for the purposes of carrying out any of
the Assistant Controller’s functions or powers under Act 599. Non-compliance
with such direction constitutes an offence.

The proposed section 124d seeks to empower an Assistant Controller to

enter any premises, other than premises used only for dwelling, to inspect
or verify any goods or document, to take samples of goods or record, or to
make copies or take extracts from any book, document, record or other article,
found in that premises.

The proposed section 124e seeks to empower an Assistant Controller to

make an arrest without warrant for any person whom he reasonably believes
has committed or is attempting to commit an offence under section 14, 16,
20 or 23. However, the Assistant Controller making the arrest shall without
unnecessary delay make over the person so arrested to the nearest police
officer or police station.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend_ section 125 of Act 599 to empower an Assistant

Controller, for the purpose of investigating into an offence, to search any
person who is in or on the premises, and seize or take possession of, and place
in safe custody all things other than the necessary clothing found upon the
person. The things for which there is reason to believe are the instruments or
evidence of the offence may be detained until an order is made by the court
for its disposal.

_Consumer Protection (Amendment)_ 33

9. _Clause 8_ seeks to introduce new sections 126a and 126b into Act 599.

The proposed section 126a seeks to provide that a search warrant issued

under Act 599 shall be valid and enforceable notwithstanding any defect,
mistake or omission therein or in the application for such warrant, and any
book, record, document, goods or thing seized under such warrant shall be
admissible in evidence in any proceedings under Act 599.

The proposed section 126b seeks to require access to be given to an Assistant

Controller to any recorded information, or computerized or digitalized data,
whether stored in a computer or otherwise, while exercising his powers under
section 125 or 126 of Act 599.

10. _Clauses 9_ and 10 seek to delete sections 128 and 129 of Act 599,

respectively. The deleted section 128 has been redrafted and renumbered as
the proposed section 124a (clause 6) to strengthen the powers of an Assistant
Controller in gathering information relating to the offences under Act 599.
Section 129 of Act 599 is deleted because the power to examine orally any
person supposedly to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the
case can be exercised by the Assistant Controller in accordance with the
proposed subsection 123(2) (clause 4) which is in line with section 112 of
the Criminal Procedure Code.

11. _Clause 11 seeks to delete section 130 of Act 599 to remove the provision_

on admissibility in evidence of any statement made by any person to an
Assistant Controller at any time whether before or after the person is charged
and whether in the course of an investigation under Act 599 or not and whether
or not wholly or partly in answer to questions. This deletion is in line with
section 113 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides that no statement
made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation
shall be used in evidence.

12. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 131 of Act 599. Subclause 12(a) seeks_

to amend subsection 131(5) of Act 599 to require an Assistant Controller to
refer the claim by any person, that he is the owner of the goods or other things
seized, to the Controller who may direct that such goods or other things be
released or forfeited, or may direct the Assistant Controller to refer the matter
to a Magistrate for a decision. _Subclause 12(b) seeks to amend subsection_
131(7) of Act 599 to require the disposal of the goods or other things forfeited
to be disposed of in accordance with the direction of the Controller.

13. _Clause 13_ seeks to introduce new sections 134a and 134b into Act 599.

The proposed section 134a seeks to deal with the admissibility of evidence

given by an agent provocateur in court.

The proposed section 134b seeks to provide that if any goods which are

the subject matter of an offence under Act 599 are found in two or more
packages or receptacles of the same description, it shall be presumed until
the contrary is proved that all the packages or receptacles contain goods of
the same nature, quantity and quality, and it shall be sufficient only to open
and examine one per centum or not less than five samples, whichever is the
lesser, of the contents of each package or receptacle seized.


-----

34 _Bill_

14. _Clause 14 seeks to introduce a new section 135a into Act 599 to provide_

for the offence of tipping-off. In this regard, any person who discloses to any
other person any information or other matter which is likely to prejudice any
investigation or proposed investigation of any offence under Act 599 commits
an offence. This is to ensure that raids done by Assistant Controllers are
effective and no leakage of information regarding a prospective raid.

15. _Clause 15 seeks to amend section 136 of Act 599 to deal with the offence_

regarding the destruction, concealment, mutilation and alteration of records,
_etc., with intent to defraud the Assistant Controller or to prevent, delay or_
obstruct the carrying out of an investigation or the exercise of any power by
the Assistant Controller under Act 599.

16. _Clause 16 seeks to amend paragraph 137(1)(a) of Act 599 to make it an_

offence for any person to submit misleading information in any application,
report or other document under Act 599.

17. _Clause 17_ seeks to amend section 138 of Act 599 to make it an offence

for any person to refuse an Assistant Controller access to any premises, to
assault, obstruct, hinder or delay the entry by the Assistant Controller into
such premises, or to refuse to give an Assistant Controller any information
relating to an offence under Act 599.

18. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 139 of Act 599. Subclause 18(a) seeks_

to amend subsection 139(1) of Act 599 to make it an offence for any person
to disclose any confidential information obtained by virtue of the provisions
of Act 599. Paragraph 18(b)(v) seeks to introduce new paragraphs 139(2)(ca),
_(cb) and_ _(cc) into Act 599. With this amendment, disclosure of confidential_
information may be made if the disclosure is made with the consent of the
person from whom the information was obtained or the disclosure is made
in circumstances where the information provided is framed in such a manner
that the source of the information could not be ascertained. Disclosure of
confidential information may also be made if the information is already in
the public domain.

19. _Clause 19 seeks to amend paragraph 146(3)(b) of Act 599 to provide that_

where an offence has been compounded, any goods, thing, book, document,
record or other article seized in connection with such offence may be released
as directed by the Controller.

20. _Clause 20_ seeks to introduce a new subsection 150(3) into Act 599 to

enable any subsidiary legislation made under Act 599 to provide for offences
and penalties of a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand ringgit or an

or subsequent offence, of a fine not exceeding two hundred and fifty thousand
ringgit or an imprisonment for a term not exceeding six years, or both.

21. _Clause 21_ seeks to provide for savings provision relating to existing

credit sale agreements.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
