-----

_Private Employment Agencies (Amendment)_ 31

13. _Clause 13_ seeks to amend section 11 of Act 246 to require a private

employment agency to renew its licence in compliance with the conditions
specified under this proposed amendment.

14. _Clause 14_ seeks to introduce a new section 11a into Act 246. The new

section 11a seeks to empower the Director General to suspend or revoke the
licence of any private employment agency.

15. _Clause 15_ seeks to amend section 13 of Act 246 to impose obligation

on a private employment agency to display its licence in a conspicuous place
in the premises and to provide for penalty provision for the contravention of
or failure to comply with such obligation.

16. _Clause 16_ seeks to introduce new sections 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d, 13e, 13f

and 13g into Act 246. The new section 13a requires a private employment
agency to apply for the replacement of a licence when it is lost, destroyed or
damaged whilst the new section 13b seeks to prevent a private employment
agency from assigning or transferring ownership of its licence to any person
without the consent of the Director General. Further, the new section 13c
seeks to prevent a private employment agency from renting out or leasing
the licence to any person and the new section 13d seeks to require a private
employment agency to apply to the Director General for an identification
document for their employees who carry out recruiting activities.

The new sections 13e, 13f and 13g seek to provide for the requirement on

a private employment agency to obtain a licence to establish branches, for the
application for changing the category of licence by the private employment
agency and to require a private employment agency to notify the Director
General if the private employment agency intends to cease its operation before
the expiry of the licence, respectively.

seeker or non-citizen employee as specified in the proposed First Schedule
of Act 246, respectively.

The new section 14c seeks to require a private employment agency to

furnish a money guarantee as specified in the proposed Second Schedule of
this Act. The new section 14d empowers the Director General to utilize the
money guarantee deposited by a private employment agency if the agency
fails to fulfil its responsibilities towards a job seeker, non-citizen employee
and employer.

The new section 14e seeks to provide for the return of the money guarantee

to the private employment agency that has ceased operations, has had its
licence revoked or the licence has expired. The new section 14f empowers the
Director General to forfeit the money guarantee where a private employment
agency fails to claim its money guarantee in the event where it has ceased
operations, had its licence revoked or the licence has expired.


-----

32 _Bill_

19. _Clause 19_ seeks to delete sections 15, 16 and 17 of Act 246. Sections

15 and 17 are deleted as the new section 9b now empowers the Director
General to impose any condition upon the granting of a licence. Section 16
is deleted because the provision in respect of recruitment of a job seeker
outside Malaysia is provided in section 8 and the proposed Second Schedule
of this Act.

penalties under Act 246.

an obligation on a private employment agency to notify the Director General

General and his officers with the powers of a police officer of whatever rank
as provided for under the Criminal Procedure Code [Act 593], in relation to
enforcement, inspection and investigation.

24. _Clauses 25_ and 26 seek to delete sections 22, 24 and 25. Section 22 is

deleted as a private employment agency is no longer deemed to be a public
place. Section 24 is deleted because the forfeiture of money guarantee is now
provided in the new section 14f. Section 25 is deleted because revocation of
licence is now provided in the new section 11a.

25. _Clause 27_ seeks to amend section 26 of Act 246 to outline the appeal

process by an aggrieved party against a decision made by the Director General
under Act 246.

26. _Clause 28 seeks to amend section 27 of Act 246 to empower the Minister_

to prescribe a fine not exceeding two hundred and fifty thousand ringgit for
contravention of or failure to comply with any provisions of any regulations
made under Act 246.

27. _Clause 29 seeks to introduce a new section 27a into Act 246 to empower_

the Minister to amend the Schedules by an order published in the _Gazette._

28. _Clause 30 seeks to amend section 28 of Act 246 to provide the offences_

and penalties under Act 246.

committed by a body corporate.

31. _Clause 34 seeks to amend section 32 of Act 246 to empower the Minister_

with the approval of the Public Prosecutor to make regulations prescribing
any offence under Act 246 to be compoundable as well as the criteria, method
and procedure for compounding such offence. This amendment also seeks to
empower the Director General to compound such offences with the consent
in writing of the Public Prosecutor.

32. _Clause 35_ seeks to amend Act 246 by introducing a new First Schedule

and Second Schedule. The new First Schedule seeks to provide for the types
of fees charged to a private employment agency under Act 246. The new
Second Schedule seeks to provide for the categories of the licence, based on
the paid–up capital of a private employment agency and the scope of the job
placement carried out and the amount of a money guarantee imposed on the
private employment agency.

33. _Clause 36_ deals with savings and transitional provisions.

34. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor

or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any financial expenditure.
