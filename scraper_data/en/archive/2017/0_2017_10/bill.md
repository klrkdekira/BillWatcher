EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Penal Code (“Act 574”) to extend the offences
of sexual connection by object as to include any part of the body except the
penis, to extend the punishment under section 326a of Act 574 for those who
causing hurt to former spouse, child _etc.,_ to include obscene documents as
part of the things prohibited to be sold, _etc., and to make the punishment of_
whipping as mandatory for the specified sexual offences.

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to include obscene documents as part of the things
prohibited to be sold, _etc., under section 292 of Act 574. For this purpose,_
such documents will include obscene online contents.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 293 of Act 574 to include obscene
documents as part of the things prohibited to be sold, _etc., under section 293_
of Act 574 to persons under the age of twenty years.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to substitute the existing section 326a of Act 574 with a
new section 326a to extend the application of this section to persons such as
former spouse, a child, an incapacitated adult and other member of family and
such persons are as defined in section 2 of the Domestic Violence Act 1994
and not limited to those who are in the subsistence of a valid marriage only.
With this proposed amendment, the court shall have the power to punish the
offender who causes hurt to his or her spouse, former spouse, a child, an
incapacitated adult or other member of the family, and commits an offence
under section 323, 324, 325, 326, 334 or 335 of Act 574 with imprisonment
for a term which may extend to twice of the maximum term for which he
would have been liable on conviction for that offence under the relevant
section notwithstanding the other punishment of fine or whipping provided

_Penal Code (Amendment)_ 5

7. _Clause 9_ seeks to amend the existing section 377ca of Act 574 to extend
the application of this section to offences involving sexual connection by using
any part of the body other than penis. This proposed amendment is in line
with the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of _Shafiee bin Awang_
_v PP_ [unreported], whereby the court decided and interpreted that finger is
included in the definition of “object” under section 377ca of Act 574. The
proposed amendment is done for the purpose of clarification and thus, the
words “or any part of the body, except the penis” are proposed to be inserted
after the words “of any object” in section 377ca of Act 574. With this proposed
amendment, when there is a case for any offence involving sexual connection
by object under section 377ca of Act 574 involving any part of the body such
as the finger or tongue, prosecution can be instituted under section 377ca of
Act 574.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in extra financial expenditure.

[PN(U2)3036]
