EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill (“the proposed Act”) seeks to amend the Domestic Violence Act
1994 (“Act 521”). The main purpose of the proposed Act is to enhance the
protection for a victim of domestic violence by making provision for an
emergency protection order as an addition to the existing interim protection
order and protection order provided under Act 521. The proposed Act also
seeks to expand the circumstances in which an act could fall under the
definition of “domestic violence”. The proposed Act also seeks to strengthen
the order that can be made under an interim protection order, and to clarify
the circumstances in which an interim protection order ceases to have effect.

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title of the proposed Act and the power of
the Minister to appoint the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 2 of Act 521. _Subclauses_ _2(a) and_ _(c)_
seek to introduce new definitions of “Director General” and “emergency
protection order” into Act 521. _Subclause 2(b) seeks to expand the definition_
of “domestic violence” by providing three more circumstances under which
domestic violence could occur. This proposed amendment will provide better
protection for the victims of domestic violence as the victims could make an
application for an interim protection order and a protection order when those
circumstances arise.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to introduce a new Part Ia into Act 521 which deals with
an emergency protection order.

The proposed new section 3a seeks to empower an authorized social welfare

officer to issue an emergency protection order for the victims of domestic
violence referred to in paragraph _(a) or_ _(b) of the definition of “domestic_
violence” under section 2 of Act 521 which involves fear of physical injury
or physical injury. An application for the emergency protection order may be
made at any time whether or not an interim protection order or a protection
order has been previously made or an application for an interim protection
order or a protection order is still pending. The emergency protection order
shall be valid for seven days only.

The proposed new section 3b seeks to provide for the procedure on the

service of an emergency protection order on the person against whom the
order is made.


-----

_Domestic Violence (Amendment)_ 13

The proposed new section 3c seeks to provide for the procedure on the

substituted service of an emergency protection order on the person against
whom the order is made if the officer in charge of the police district or any
other police officer under his command is not able to serve the copy of the
emergency protection order to the person personally within twelve hours of
receiving a copy of the order.

The proposed new section 3d seeks to require the officer in charge of the

police district or any other police officer under his command to file proof
of service of the copy of the emergency protection order effected under the
proposed new section 3b or 3c with the authorized social welfare officer, and
communicate the service effected to the victim, within twelve hours of the
service.

The proposed new section 3e seeks to provide that any person who wilfully

contravenes an emergency protection order commits an offence, and any person
who wilfully contravenes an emergency protection order by using violence on
a protected person also commits an offence.

The proposed new section 3f seeks to require an authorized social welfare

officer to maintain a record of all applications for emergency protection orders
as well as the emergency protection orders issued.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 521._

_Subclause 4(a) seeks to introduce new subsections 4(3a), (3b) and (3c) into_

Act 521 to provide for better protection to the victims of domestic violence.
The proposed new subsection 4(3a) seeks to provide that an interim protection
order issued under subsection 4(1) of Act 521 may, where the court is satisfied
that it is necessary for the protection and personal safety of the spouse or
former spouse, child, incapacitated adult or any other member of the family,
as the case may be, provide for any one or more of the orders specified in
paragraphs 6(1)(a) to _(f) of Act 521 which are currently only available in a_
protection order. This proposed amendment allows the orders that can be made
in a protection order, that are the orders specified in paragraphs 6(1)(a) to _(f)_
of Act 521, to also be made in an interim protection order. This will enable
the courts to provide the same protection to the victims of domestic violence
whether under a protection order or an interim protection order.

The proposed new subsection 4(3b) seeks to provide that for the purpose

of making the orders under the proposed new subsection 4(3a), the safeguards
in relation to the right to occupy a shared residence, _etc., provided in the_
existing subsections 6(3), (4) and (5) of Act 521 shall apply. This will enable
the safeguards in relation to the right to occupy a shared residence, _etc.,_
which is available when a protection order is made, to also be applicable to
an interim protection order.

The proposed new subsection 4(3c) seeks to provide that the orders provided

under the proposed subsection 4(3a) shall have effect for the duration of the
interim protection order.


-----

14 _Bill_

_Subclause 4(b) seeks to amend subsection 4(4) of Act 521 to provide for_

clearer circumstances in which an interim protection order ceases to have
effect. This proposed amendment will enable a victim to know exactly when
an interim protection order ceases to have effect and when the victim is no
longer protected under an interim protection order. This proposed amendment
will also provide continuous protection to a victim under an interim protection
order until the determination of the victim’s application for a protection order
by the court if the victim applies for the protection order within seven days
after being informed by a police officer that a criminal proceeding relating to
the commission of an offence involving domestic violence will be instituted
against the person against whom the order is made.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend paragraph 5(1)(a) of Act 521 to clarify that the
court may issue a protection order restraining the person against whom the
order is made from using domestic violence against the victim and not the
complainant. The word “victim” is used because it is more accurate than the
word “complainant”.

7. _Clause 6_ seeks to amend section 6 of Act 521. Paragraph 6(a)(i) seeks
to amend paragraph 6(1)(a) of Act 521 to allow the court, if satisfied that
it is necessary for the protection and personal safety of the victim, child or
incapacitated adult, to grant the right of exclusive occupation of the whole
shared residence in a protection order to a protected person. With this proposed
amendment, the court is no longer allowed to grant the right of exclusive
occupation of only a specified part of the shared residence to a protected
person. The grant of the right of exclusive occupation of the whole shared
residence to a protected person is to ensure the safety of the protected person.
The safety of the protected person will be at stake if the protected person is
only granted the right of exclusive occupation of only a specified part of the
shared residence whereby the other part of the shared residence is occupied
by the person against whom the order is made.

_Subclause 6(b) seeks to introduce a new subsection 6(1a) into Act 521 to_

specify that the orders provided in the protection order shall have effect for
such period not exceeding twelve months from the date of the commencement
of such order as may be specified in the protection order. This provision is
redrafted from the existing subsection 6(1) of Act 521.

8. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 11 of Act 521.

_Subclause 8(b) seeks to amend subsection 11(1) of Act 521 to empower the_

court, in an application for a protection order, to make an order that one or
more of the parties to the dispute be referred to a rehabilitation programme,
provided that an order to refer the victim to a rehabilitation programme shall
be made only with the consent of the victim. This order is in addition to
issuing a protection order.

_Subclause 8(c) seeks to delete subsections 11(1a) and (1b) of Act 521 to_

remove the provisions on the conciliatory body. With this proposed amendment,
the conciliatory body will no longer exist but the court may order the parties
involved to be referred to a rehabilitation programme.


-----

_Domestic Violence (Amendment)_ 15

_Subclause 8(f) seeks to amend subsection 11(4) of Act 521 to provide for_

the definition of “rehabilitation programme” which means the programme
provided by the Ministry responsible for welfare services for the purposes of
family and community development.

9. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section_ 12a of Act 521. _Subclauses 9(b), (c)_ and
_(d) seek to clarify that the application for an interim protection order shall be_
made _ex-parte by the victim, the victim’s counsel or a social welfare officer_
on behalf of the victim. The word “victim” is used because it is more accurate
than the word “applicant”.

10. _Clause 10_ seeks to amend section 13 of Act 521 to provide for the

circumstances in which a protection order may be sought. A protection order
may be sought within seven days after the victim being informed in writing by
a police officer under the proposed paragraph 4(4)(b) that a criminal proceedings
relating to the commission of an offence involving domestic violence will be
instituted against the person against whom the order is made. A protection
order may also be sought at any stage of the criminal proceedings under the
Penal Code or any other written law where the accused is charged with an
offence involving domestic violence whether or not an interim protection
order or emergency protection order has been sought and issued against the
accused.

11. _Clause 11_ seeks to introduce a new section 13a into Act 521 to provide

that an application for a protection order shall be made by the victim, the
victim’s counsel, a social welfare officer on behalf of the victim or a police
officer on behalf of the victim.

12. _Clause 12 seeks to amend paragraphs 14(a) and (d) of Act 521 to clarify_

that the application for a protection order or an interim protection order
involving a complaint of domestic violence may be filed in any district where
the victim resides or the victim is placed temporarily. The word “victim” is
used because it is more accurate than the word “complainant”.

13. _Clause 13_ seeks to amend subsection 17(2) of Act 521 to require the

officer in charge of the police district or any other police officer under
his command to communicate the service of an interim protection order or
a protection order effected to the victim within seven days of service.

14. _Clause 15 seeks to amend subsection 19(2) of Act 521 to impose additional_

duties on an enforcement officer, who is a police officer, to inform the victim
on the status of the investigations relating to an offence involving domestic
violence and the status of the application for the interim protection order and
protection order, _etc._

15. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
and consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the
amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.
