EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Stamp Act 1949 (“Act 378”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and the provision on the commencement
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 2 of Act 378 to amend certain existing
definitions and introduce new definitions.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 3a of Act 378. With the introduction
of self-assessment, the power of the Collector is expanded for the purpose
of conducting audit. The Collector may require a person to attend personally
before him and search such lands, buildings and places to which he has access.
Obstruction or refusal to permit entry, refusal to produce instrument, book,
account, record or other document and failure to provide reasonable facilities and
assistance for purposes of audit shall be an offence. The proposed amendment
also seeks to increase the maximum fine from two hundred and fifty ringgit
to ten thousand ringgit, to reflect the severity of any non-compliance.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 378 to provide that the_
chargeability to and exemption from stamp duty on instruments is subject to
this Act only. This section also provides that all instruments chargeable with
duty shall be duly stamped.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend subsection 4a(3) of Act 378 to increase the
penalty for the offence of registering any instrument of transfer which is not
duly stamped in accordance with subsection 4a(2) of Act 378.

60 _Bill_

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 378 to provide that the application_
of section 6 is subject to Act 378 only.

8. _Clause 7_ seeks to amend section 7 of Act 378 to include mode of paying

the true date of the making of such impression. The proposed amendment also
seeks to provide for the time for franking of instruments and to increase the
penalty for the offence under this section.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 9 of Act 378 to empower the Collector_

to authorize any person, by notification in the _Gazette, to compound for the_
payment of duty on specified instruments in accordance with the conditions
laid down under this section. The proposed amendment also seeks to increase
the further payment under subsection (3) from two hundred ringgit or ten per
centum of the amount due to five hundred ringgit or twenty per centum of
the amount due.

11. _Clause 10_ seeks to amend section 10 of Act 378 to reflect the current

stamping practice which no longer uses stamped paper.

12. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend section 11 of Act 378 to provide that the

chargeability of duty on instruments which depends on duty paid on another
instrument shall be applicable to instruments which are assessed or deemed

affecting the liability of the original instrument to duty has been fully and truly
set forth. The proposed amendment also seeks to provide that the presentation
of the replicate of the instrument shall be made within six years from the date
of execution of such instrument.

14. _Clause 13 seeks to introduce a new section 11b into Act 378 to deal with_

the loss of stamp certificate where upon application made to the Collector,
the Collector may issue a substituted stamp certificate when it is shown to
his satisfaction that all facts and circumstances affecting the liability of the
original instrument to duty has been fully and truly set forth and the amount
of duty chargeable has been paid.

15. _Clause 14_ seeks to amend section 12 of Act 378 to introduce the new

stamping practise whereby duplicates and counterparts of an instrument shall
not be deemed to be duly stamped unless it is shown to the Collector that
the original instrument has been stamped.

_Stamp (Amendment)_ 61

16. _Clauses 15,_ _19,_ _20_ and _25 seeks to amend sections_ 12a, 17, 20 and 29a

of Act 378 as a consequence of the amendment to the First Schedule.

17. _Clause 16_ seeks to amend section 15 of Act 378 by extending the

period in which the companies have to remain as the beneficial owner of the
shares, from two years to three years in order to obtain exemption under this
section. Each company which was a party to the instrument is also required
to inform the Collector of any change in the circumstances within thirty days
of its occurrence. The duty payer must fulfil all the conditions as provided
for under that section before relief is granted.

18. _Clause 17_ seeks to amend section 15a of Act 378 to provide that a

company cannot dispose of the asset that it has acquired within three years
of the date of conveyance or transfer and shall remain associated for a period
of three years. The proposed amendment also stipulates that stamp duty and
interest will be charged if it is found that the declaration or evidence furnished
in support of the claim for exemption under this section is not true. The duty
payer must fulfil all the conditions as provided for under that section before
relief is granted.

19. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 16 of Act 378 by deleting subsection (2)_

the Collector to appoint any person to be the agent of the duty payer and
that person shall be required to pay any duty or penalty due under the this
Act on behalf of the duty payer from any moneys including sale proceeds or
rents. Failure of the agent to pay such duty or penalty renders it a debt due
to the Government. The new section 33a further provides that the Collector
may require any person to give him information as to any moneys, funds or
other assets which may be held by him for, or of any moneys due by him to,
the duty payer. If the agent is aggrieved by the appointment, he may object
to the appointment by notice in writing to the Collector within thirty days
from the date of appointment.

and relevant documents in relation to the instrument which has been stamped

fourteen days from the date of assessment. In the case of a return in which
the duty payer opts to assess the duty for himself, the return is deemed to be
an assessment made by the Collector and the deemed assessment shall be due
and payable within fourteen days from the date the return is furnished. The
proposed amendment also allows the Collector to make an assessment where
an instrument chargeable with duty is not duly stamped. This section also
provides that the deemed assessment is also subject to section 50a of Act 378.
