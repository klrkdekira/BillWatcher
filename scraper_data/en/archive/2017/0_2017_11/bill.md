tax to be charged and levied on the tourists by an order published in the
_Gazette. The rate of the tourism tax is fixed with the concurrence of the_
minister charged with the responsibility for tourism. The order shall be laid
in the Dewan Rakyat.

of tourists from the payment of the whole or any part of the tourism tax, or
to exempt any operator or any class of operator from collecting the whole or
any part of the tourism tax, to exempt any operator or class of operator from
the requirement to register under Part IV of the proposed Act, or exempt any
person from all or any provision of the proposed Act.

Part IV

14. Part IV contains provisions relating to the registration of operator.

15. _Clauses 10 and_ _11 seek to provide for the liability of the operator to_

apply to the Director General to be registered. The application shall be made
within thirty days from the date an operator operates the accommodation
premises. As for an existing operator, the application shall be made within
thirty days from the coming into operation of this Part. Any contravention to
the requirement constituted an offence punishable with a fine not exceeding
thirty thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year
or to both.

16. _Clause 12 seeks to empower the Director General to register any operator_

document showing an amount which purports to be tourism tax. This _clause_
further provides for contravention of this clause to be an offence

20. _Clause 15_ seeks to allow an invoice, receipt or other document to be

transmitted or made available by electronic means.

21. _Clause 16 seeks to require an operator to make adjustments in his returns_

if he issued a credit note or debit note.

22. _Clause 17 seeks to require an operator to keep records in relation to his_

tourism tax liability in Malaysia either in the national language or English
language for seven years. This _clause further provides for contravention of_
this _clause to be an offence._

23. _Clause 18 seeks to assign the taxable period of an operator to be three_

months or a period similar to the taxable period assigned to him for the
purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 2014 [Act 762], if the operator
has been assigned with a taxable period for the purposes of the Goods and
Services Tax Act 2014.

24. _Clause 19 seeks to require an operator to account for tourism tax in a_

return and furnish it within the stipulated time. This _clause also requires an_
operator to pay for the tourism tax and to furnish a return whether or not there
is a tourism tax to be paid. It also provides for contravention of this _clause_
to be an offence. This _clause also provides the penalty of up to 90 days to_
be paid by the operator who fails to pay wholly or partly of the tourism tax
due within the stipulated time if no prosecution is instituted.

25. _Clause 20 seeks to allow the Director General to assess the amount of_

tourism tax and penalty payable if an operator fails to apply for registration,
fails to furnish a return or furnishes an incomplete or incorrect return. This
_clause limits the time frame of not more than six years after the end of a_
taxable period for the Director General to make an assessment except in cases
of fraud. It also allows the Director General to make an assessment where
the tourism tax and penalty has been paid but no return has been furnished
or the person fails to furnish a return for any subsequent taxable period. The
Director General shall increase the amount of tourism tax assessed in the
case where an operator pays tourism tax according to the assessed amount
but continually fails to submit returns. This clause further deems the assessed
amount to be the correct tourism tax and penalty that is due from the operator
unless the assessment is subsequently withdrawn or reduced. This clause also
allows the Director General to make a supplementary assessment in excess
of an earlier assessment and amend the assessment to ensure the correctness
of his assessment.

Part VI

26. Part VI contains provisions relating to remission, refund and recovery.

27. _Clause 21 seeks to allow the Minister to remit the whole or any part of the_

tourism tax and the Director General to remit the whole or any part of the

other money remitted if the person has paid the tourism tax, penalty, surcharge
or other money.

28. _Clause 22 seeks to allow a person who has overpaid or erroneously paid_

any tourism tax, penalty, surcharge or any other money to claim for a refund
within six years from the date the overpayment or erroneous payment occurred.
The Director General may refund such tourism tax, penalty, surcharge or any
other money if he is satisfied that such overpayment has occurred. This clause
further empowers the Director General to reduce or disallow any refund if
the refund may unjustly enrich the claimant. Any claim shall be supported by
evidence as required by the Director General.

29. _Clause 23 seeks to provide for a person to be entitled for bad debt_

claim if he has not received payment within a stipulated time in relation to
the accommodation provided by him and he has also made sufficient effort
to recover the debt. A person who is entitled to a bad debt claim may make
a claim for the refund of the whole amount of the tourism tax if he has not
received any payment for the accommodation and for the difference between
the tourism tax paid and the part payment received if he has received part
payment for the accommodation which is less than the tourism tax paid.
However, the person shall not be entitled to any refund if the part payment
received is equal to or more than the amount of the tourism tax he has paid.

30. _Clause 24 seeks to allow the Director General to approve any application_

by an operator to deduct from time to time from his tourism tax return the
amount of tourism tax paid but subsequently refunded to his customer by
reason of cancellation of accommodation or other reason as may be approved
by the Director General within one year after the payment was made or such
extended period as may be approved by the Director General.

31. _Clause 25 seeks to require a person holding money for or owing money_

to an operator to pay to the Director General if the operator owes tourism
tax, penalty, surcharge or other money upon a written notice been made to
the person. The payment made by the person is deemed to be the payment
made on behalf of the operator.

32. _Clause 26 empowers the Director General to allow any unpaid tourism tax_

or penalty to be paid in instalments and if tourism tax is allowed to be paid in
instalments, penalty will not apply to the unpaid tourism tax. A surcharge of
ten per cent shall be imposed on the outstanding amount if there is a default
in the payment of any instalment and the outstanding amount together with
the surcharge shall become due and payable or taxable on the date the default
occurs.

33. _Clause 27 seeks to allow the Director General to request any Director of_

Immigration to prevent any person from leaving the country if the person owes
tourism tax, penalty, surcharge or other moneys. The Director of Immigration
may retain travel documents if a request has been made by the Director
General. This _clause requires the Director General to give a notice to the_
person informing him that he is prevented from leaving the country and any
non-receipt of the notice does not prevent the Director of Immigration from
performing his duties. A person is allowed to leave the country if he is able
to show proof that the tourism tax, penalty, surcharge or other moneys owed
have been paid or he has furnished a security sufficient to pay the tourism
tax, penalty, surcharge or other moneys owed.

six years from the date on which the refund was made.

35. _Clause 29 empowers the Minister to recover any tourism tax due and_

payable and any penalty, surcharge or other money payable as a civil debt to
the Government. The issuance of a certificate signed by the Director General
shall be taken as sufficient evidence for court proceedings. The _clause treats_
penalty and surcharge as tourism tax and sets aside the time limit imposed on
the collection of penalties under the Limitation Act 1953 [Act 254], Limitation
Ordinance of Sabah [Sabah Cap. 72] and Limitation Ordinance of Sarawak

[Sarawak Cap. 49].

36. _Clause 30 seeks to provide for the recovery of any amount which purports_

to be tourism tax even though the invoice, receipt or other document is not
an invoice, a receipt or other document issued under section 14, or the person
issuing the invoice, receipt or other document is not an operator or the invoice,
receipt or other document was issued by an operator for a product or service
other than accommodation.

37. _Clause 31 seeks to provide for the liability of directors of companies,_

partners of firms or committee members of societies to pay any unpaid tax,
penalty or surcharge.

the purpose of enforcement, inspection and investigation under the proposed
Act.

have full and free access to any place or premises relating to the business
of accommodation premises. This _clause requires the operator and any other_
person present at the place or premises to assist the senior officer of customs
in carrying out his duties.

recorded information or computerized data whether stored in a computer or

records or thing which may afford evidence of an offence may be removed
by reason of delay in obtaining a search warrant.


-----

50 _Bill_

44. _Clause 37 seeks to provide for the seizure of books, data, documents_

or other records or thing in relation to an offence. The officer of customs is
required to give notice in writing of any seizure to the owner of the books, data,
documents or other records or thing. This clause also specifies that provisions
relating to seizure shall apply to anything contained in any receptacle, package
or conveyance in which the books, data, documents or other records or thing
are found and to any article used to conceal the same.

45. _Clause 38 seeks to provide for the power of any officer of customs to_

arrest without warrant any person found committing or attempting to commit
or employing or aiding any person to commit or abetting the commission of
an offence under the proposed Act, any person reasonably suspected to have
in his possession any books, data, documents or other records or thing liable
to seizure under the proposed Act or any person reasonably suspected to have
committed an offence under the proposed Act. Any officer of customs making
an arrest shall bring the person arrested to the nearest police station without
unnecessary delay. This _clause further provides for the power to arrest any_
person who is liable to be arrested but not arrested at the time of committing
the offence or who escapes after being arrested as if he had been arrested at
the time of committing the offence. The person arrested may be released from
custody if he has deposited a reasonable sum of money or execute a bond
with surety or deposits a reasonable sum of money and execute a bond with
surety. A person who is released from custody may be arrested without warrant
if there are reasonable grounds to believe that any condition for release of
