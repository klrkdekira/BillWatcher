is in a relationship of trust with the child, such person shall, in addition
to the punishment to which he is liable for such offence, be punished with
imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and shall also be punished
with whipping of not less than two strokes. A person is said to be in a

Part VI

thinks otherwise.

evidence of a child, given upon oath or otherwise, be admissible. However,
the court, before allowing for the uncorroborated evidence of a child to be
admissible, shall ascertain that the child is possessed of sufficient intelligence
and understands the duty of speaking the truth. This provision is a departure

20 _Bill_

from section 133a of the Evidence Act 1950 [Act 56] which provides that
a person cannot be convicted upon uncorroborated evidence not given upon
oath by a child of tender years. Nevertheless this provision is to enhance the
status of children as witnesses so that their evidence is given the appropriate
weight.

Part VII

27. Part VII of the proposed Act contains miscellaneous provisions.

28. _Clause 20 seeks to provide that notwithstanding section 13 of the Criminal_

Procedure Code [Act 593], any person who fails to give information of the
commission of or the intention of any other person to commit any offence
under the proposed Act, or any offence under the Schedule where the victim
is a child, to the officer in charge of the nearest police station, commits an
offence and shall on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand
ringgit.

29. _Clause 21_ seeks to provide that it is not a defence to a charge for any

offence under the proposed Act, or any offence under the Schedule where the
victim is a child, that the accused believed that the child was eighteen years
of age or more at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed
unless the accused took all reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the child.

30. _Clause 22 seeks to provide for the abetment of any offence under the_

proposed Act. Any person who abets the commission of any offence punishable
under the proposed Act shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence
of the abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.
As to the punishment for any attempt of any offence under the proposed Act,
or any offence under the Schedule where the victim is a child, section 511 of
the Penal Code shall be applicable.

31. _Clause 23 seeks to provide that notwithstanding any law or rule of law_

to the contrary, evidence of _agent provocateur shall be admissible in any_
proceedings against any person for an offence under the proposed Act, or any
offence under the Schedule where the victim is a child, except for an offence
under sections 14 and 15 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling
of Migrants Act 2007 [Act 670]. For the purposes of the Anti-Trafficking
in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007, the provision on the
admissibility of the evidence of _agent provocateur_ is already provided for in
section 59 of the Act. This clause also provides that a conviction in relation to
such offences solely on the uncorroborated evidence of any agent provocateur
shall not be illegal.

32. _Clause 24 seeks to provide that sections 173a, 293 and 294 of the_

Criminal Procedure Code shall not apply in respect of any offence under the
proposed Act, or any offence under the Schedule where the victim is a child,
if the person convicted for such offence is of or above the age of eighteen
years. This _clause however, shall not apply in respect of offence under the_
Penal Code relating to the non-application of sections 173a and 294 of the
Criminal Procedure Code to a serious offence under the Penal Code. By

_Sexual Offences against Children_ 21

virtue of the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) 2016 [Act A1521]which
came into operation on 1 March 2017, sections 173a and 294 of the Criminal
Procedure Code have been amended to provide that these sections shall not
apply, among others, to a serious offence under the Penal Code. Under the
Penal Code, “serious offence” denotes an offence punishable with imprisonment
for a term of ten years or more.

33. _Clause 25 provides for the exception to the application of paragraph 289(c)_

of the Criminal Procedure Code. Under paragraph 289(c) of the Criminal
Procedure Code, males whom the court considers to be more than fifty years
of age shall not be punishable for whipping if he is convicted of an offence
except for offences under section 376, 377c, 377ca or 377e of the Penal
Code. This _clause seeks to provide that notwithstanding paragraph 289(c) of_
the Criminal Procedure Code, where a person convicted for any offence under
the proposed Act is a male whom the court considers to be more than fifty
years of age, he may still be punished with whipping. This is provided after
taking into account the seriousness of the offences under the proposed Act.

34. _Clause 26 seeks to provide that the Minister may, upon consultation_

with the Public Prosecutor, to amend the Schedule by order published in the
_Gazette_ including to exclude or include any offence of any description under
any written law.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
