EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act 2011
(“Act 723”).


-----

_Price Control and Anti-Profiteering (Amendment)_ 3

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to introduce new sections 10b and 10c into Act 723.

The proposed section 10b seeks to require any person who displays,

advertises, publishes or quotes or causes to be displayed, advertised, published
or quoted the prices of any goods or charges for any services to include in
the prices or charges all government taxes, duties and charges and all other
charges which are to be imposed by the person on his goods or services.

This is to overcome the display of prices or charges that are subject to

multiple additional charges, resulting in higher final prices or charges to be
paid by consumers. The proposed section 10b is introduced into Act 723 to
promote transparency in the display, advertisement, publication or quotation
of prices or charges.

The proposed section 10c seeks to empower the Controller to direct any

person who supplies or offers to supply any goods or services to provide
to the Controller any return, document or information containing the prices
of any goods or charges for any services imposed by such person and any
other information as the Controller deems necessary. The return, document or
information provided by the person shall be true, accurate and complete.

The information collected under the proposed section 10c will enable the

government to obtain data on prices of goods and charges for services for
analysis purposes. Prices and charges collected and analyzed will help the
government to monitor prices of goods and charges for services in the market.

Any person who contravenes the provisions of the proposed sections 10b

and 10c commits an offence and shall be liable to the general penalty under
section 57 of Act 723 of a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand ringgit
and, for a second or subsequent offence, of a fine not exceeding two hundred
and fifty thousand ringgit where the person is a body corporate and of a
fine not exceeding fifty thousand ringgit or of imprisonment for a term not
exceeding two years or of both fine and imprisonment and, for a second or
subsequent offence, of a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand ringgit
or of imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or of both fine and
imprisonment where the person is not a body corporate.

4. Clause 3 seeks to amend subsection 28(1) of Act 723 to allow Assistant
Controllers to have access to any places or premises where any business is
carried out for the purpose of inspecting the prices of goods or charges for
services.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in extra financial expenditure.
