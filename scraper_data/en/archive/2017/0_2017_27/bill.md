50 _Bill_

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1952
(Ordinance 70/1952) (“the Ordinance”). The main purposes of the amendment
are to encourage the registration of ships in the Malaysia Ship Register and
Malaysia International Ship Register, to provide for the registration of ships
on bareboat charter, to empower the Director of Marine to licence persons or
organizations to provide service undertakings and port undertakings at ports
where the Director of Marine is exercising his power as the port authority, and
to establish the Malaysia Shipping Development Fund. This Bill also seeks to
strengthen the provisions in respect of licensing of ships and domestic shipping.

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and the provision on the commencement
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 contains the general amendment to substitute the words “steamer”_
and “steamship” for the word “ship” and the words “steamers” and “steamships”
for the word “ships”. The usages of those words are no longer relevant because
“steamer” and “steamship” are also “ships”. Prior to the amendment, different
standards were applied to different categories of ships according to their
mode of propulsion. Therefore it was necessary to distinguish the technical
difference between “steamer” and “steamship” and “ship”. However, pursuant
to international conventions and standards, ships are now governed by the
same standard, regardless of their mode of propulsion. With the substitution
of the words “steamer” and “steamship” with the word “ship” and the words
“steamers” and “steamships” for the word “ships”, section 3 of the Ordinance
is deleted in _clause 4_ of the Bill as there is no longer a necessity to extend
the application of the Ordinance to ships propelled by electricity, internal
combustion engine or other mechanical power.

4. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 of the Ordinance to amend existing
definitions and to introduce new definitions.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 10 of the Ordinance._ _Subclause 5(a)_
seeks to enable the Director of Marine to appoint the Surveyor-General of
Ships, Surveyor of Ships and Radio Surveyor. Subclause 5(b) seeks to provide
for the appointment of persons or organizations to perform specific functions
of the Surveyor of Ships or Radio Surveyor in accordance with the Code for
Recognized Organizations adopted by the International Maritime Organization,
which Malaysia is a member, in accordance with Resolution MSC.349(92) and
MEPC.237(65). Subclause 5(c) seeks to provide for rule-making power of the
Minister to regulate persons and organizations appointed to perform specific
functions of the Surveyor of Ships or Radio Surveyor.

6. _Clause 6 seeks to introduce a new section 10a into the Ordinance. The new_
section 10a seeks to establish that the Director of Marine shall be the authority
for ports where no port authority has been established under any written law.
The new section 10a also seeks to empower the Director of Marine to issue
licence to persons or organizations to provide service undertakings or port
undertakings in respect of the ports. The new section 10a further empowers
the Minister to make regulations to give effect to the provision.


-----

_Merchant Shipping (Amendment)_ 51

7. _Clause 7_ seeks to substitute Parts IIa, IIb and IIc of the Ordinance with
Parts II and IIa.

The proposed Part II provides for the registration and licensing of ships

consisting of sections 11 to 68q.

The proposed section 11 contains the definition of words and phrases used

in the proposed Part II.

The proposed section 12 seeks to empower the Director of Marine to appoint

the Registrar and Deputy Registrars. Prior to the amendment, the Registrar and
the Deputy Registrars were known as the Registrar General and registrars.

The proposed section 13 seeks to provide for the functions and powers of

the Registrar.

The proposed section 14 seeks to provide for the Malaysia Ship Register

and Malaysia International Ship Register to be maintained by the Registrar.
The Register may be in both physical and electronic form.

The proposed section 15 seeks to empower the Registrar to rectify the

Register should any clerical error occur and the Registrar may issue a new
certificate of registry if necessary.

The proposed section 16 seeks to empower the Director of Marine to issue

written instructions to the Registrar for the better carrying out of the provisions
of this Ordinance.

The proposed section 17 seeks to provide for the establishment of a ship

registration office and its branch offices.

The proposed section 18 seeks to require ships navigating in Malaysian

waters or the exclusive economic zone to be registered either in Malaysia
or any other country and provides for the penalty for contravention of the
proposed provision.

The proposed section 19 seeks to provide for the qualifications for persons

to own a Malaysian ship. A person qualified to own a Malaysian ship under
the Malaysia Ship Register must be a Malaysian citizen or, to an extent as may
be determined by the Minister, a body corporate incorporated in Malaysia. A
person who is qualified to own a Malaysian ship under the Malaysia International
Ship Register must be a Malaysian citizen or a body corporate incorporated in
Malaysia. However, a non-Malaysian citizen or a body corporate incorporated
outside Malaysia may also own a Malaysian ship under the Malaysia International
Ship Register if that person or body corporate appoints a representative person
under the proposed subsection 20(3). The representative person appointed must
be a Malaysian citizen having a permanent residence in Malaysia or a body
corporate incorporated in Malaysia having its principal place of business in
Malaysia. The provision for the requirement of appointment of a representative
person replaces the requirement for the appointment of a ship manager under
section 66c of the Ordinance. The proposed section 19 also provides that ships
on bareboat charter may be registered under the Malaysia Ship Register or
the Malaysia International Ship Register. Prior to this amendment, there was
no law in Malaysia for the registration of ships on bareboat charter.


-----

52 _Bill_

The proposed section 20 seeks to provide the procedures for an application

for registration as a Malaysian ship.

The proposed section 21 seeks to provide for the requirement for survey

and measurement of a ship by the Surveyor of Ships to ascertain the ship’s
tonnage before the ship may be registered as a Malaysian ship.

The proposed section 22 seeks to provide for the requirement of a ship’s

proposed name to be submitted to the Registrar for his approval prior to the
registration of the ship. The proposed section 22 sets out the grounds on which
a Registrar may refuse to approve a proposed name for a ship.

The proposed section 23 seeks to require the marking of ships to be done

prior to the ship being registered. A ship’s marking must be permanently
maintained and not altered and the owner or master of the ship who fails to
maintain a ship’s marking as required by the proposed provision commits an
offence.

The proposed section 24 seeks to empower the Registrar, for the purpose of

registration of a ship, to require any additional information or documents. The
Registrar may also go on board a ship to inspect the ship and any documents
relating to the ship.

The proposed section 25 seeks to provide for the registration of a ship or

refusal to register a ship by the Registrar.

The proposed section 26 seeks to provide that the Registrar may provisionally

register any ship and issue a provisional certificate of registry. A provisional
certificate has the same effect as a certificate of registry.

The proposed section 27 seeks to empower the Minister to prohibit

registration of any ship if he is satisfied that the registration will prejudice
national interest.

The proposed section 28 seeks to provide for the issuance of a certificate

of registry upon registration of a ship as a Malaysian ship. For the purpose of
navigation of a ship, the master or owner of the Malaysian ship shall not use
or permit the use of a certificate of registry that has not been issued under
the provision or has expired and is not in force.

The proposed section 29 seeks to impose a duty on the master or owner of

a Malaysian ship to inform the Registrar of any changes of particulars relating
to the ship.

The proposed section 30 seeks to provide that a certificate of registry

issued by the Registrar shall be used only for the purpose of navigation and
shall not be used as a security for any civil right or claim. The proposed
section 30 further provides that a person who refuses to deliver the certificate
of registry to the person entitled to the custody of the certificate of registry
or to the Registrar without reasonable cause commits an offence.


-----

_Merchant Shipping (Amendment)_ 53

The proposed section 31 seeks to provide that the Registrar may issue a

new certificate of registry if the certificate of registry is mislaid, lost, defaced
or destroyed. If a new certificate is issued the original certificate shall be
deemed to have been revoked.

The proposed section 32 seeks to provide that the Registrar may suspend

the registration of a Malaysian ship upon the application of the owner or if
the ship is taken in war or hostilities.

The proposed section 33 seeks to provide for the circumstances under which

the Registrar may terminate the registration of a Malaysian ship.

The proposed section 34 seeks to provide that the Registrar may delete a

Malaysian ship from the Register upon the application from a ship owner or
when the registration of a ship is terminated under section 33. The proposed
section 34 further protects any encumbrances entered in the Register in respect
of the Malaysian ship, notwithstanding the deletion from the Register.

The proposed section 35 seeks to provide that the Registrar may revoke

the certificate of registry of a Malaysian ship if the registration of the ship
is suspended or terminated or when the period of validity of the certificate of
registry has lapsed. The proposed section 35 further imposes a duty upon the
owner or master of the ship to surrender the revoked certificate of registry
to the Registrar, failing which would amount to an offence.

The proposed section 36 provides that the Director of Marine shall notify

the authority in the country of primary registry if the registration of a bareboat
chartered-in ship is terminated or suspended.

The proposed section 37 provides the owner of a Malaysian ship the right

to dispose of the ship. This provision also recognizes interests arising under
contract and equity and allows for such interests to be enforced by or against
the owners and mortgagees of any ship, in which case, the ship is treated as
if it were any other personal property in law.

The proposed section 38 seeks to empower the Registrar to give consent

to owner of a Malaysian ship to register his ship as a bareboat charter in
another country, to be known as a “bareboat chartered-out ship”. However,
the proposed section 38 also empowers the Minister to disallow any Malaysian
ship to be bareboat chartered-out notwithstanding the Registrar’s consent.

The proposed section 39 seeks to provide for the procedures for transfer of

a Malaysian ship. The proposed section 39 recognizes that a bill of sale may
not be in the prescribed form as previously provided for in the Ordinance and
therefore accepts any bill of sale as valid as long as the required particulars
are stated for registration.

The proposed section 40 deals with transmission of a Malaysian ship other

than by way of transfer under the proposed section 39, which is transfer by
operation of law in circumstances such as death and bankruptcy. A person
who receives the shares in a Malaysian ship by way of transmission can only
be registered as the owner of that ship if he applies for registration and if he
is qualified to own a Malaysian ship.


-----

54 _Bill_

The proposed section 41 seeks to provide that a person who is not qualified

to own a Malaysian ship who received the shares in the ship by way of
transmission may apply to the Court for an order for the sale of the ship. This
application shall be made within twenty-eight days from the date of transmission
and may be extended by the Court up to one year. If the application for the
order for sale is not made within this period, or if the application is refused
by the court, the shares may be forfeited.

The proposed section 42 seeks to provide that an order for sale made by

the Court under the proposed section 41 shall contain a declaration vesting
in an individual the right to transfer the property in a ship. For the purpose
of this section, such individual shall be treated as if he were the owner of
the ship.

The proposed section 43 seeks to provide that the Court may prohibit for

a specified period any dealings with a registered ship on the application of
any interested person.

The proposed section 44 provides that a registered ship other than a

bareboat chartered-in ship may be used as security for mortgage. Under such
circumstances, the Registrar shall register the mortgage according to the
priority in which it was produced for registration. The proposed section 44
also seeks to provide for mortgagor and mortgagee’s rights in a registered
ship and ensures that bareboat chartered-in ship cannot be used as security.

The proposed section 45 seeks to clarify that the priority of registered

mortgages is based on the concept of “first in time of registration”. This is
consistent with general maritime law in relation to priority of mortgages.

The proposed section 46 seeks to provide that a mortgagee may sell the ship

in order to realize the debt secured by the property in the ship. If there are
two or more mortgages registered in the same ship, the subsequent mortgagee,
unless by an order of the Court, shall not sell the ship without the approval
of the prior mortgagee.

The proposed section 47 seeks to provide for assignment of mortgages

where the assignee shall have the same right of preference as the assignor.

The proposed section 48 seeks to recognize the mortgagee’s interest in the

ship as security for a loan and that the mortgagor is still the owner of the ship
for the purposes of this Ordinance. The proposed provision seeks to protect
the interest of the owner as well as the mortgagee whereby the mortgagee
shall not be treated as the owner of a ship so mortgaged.

The proposed section 49 seeks to allow for the transmission of mortgage
