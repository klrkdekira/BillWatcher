16. Part IV deals with the registration of industries and employees, and

contribution to be made under the proposed Act.

17. _Clause 13 seeks to empower the Organization to determine whether any_

activity carried out by any person falls within the meaning of “industry” to
which the proposed Act applies.

18. _Clause 14 seeks to require every employer to register his industry to_

which the proposed Act applies with the Organization within such period and
in such manner as prescribed. Any employer who fails to register his industry
within such period as prescribed commits an offence.

19. _Clause 15_ seeks to provide that an employer that has registered his

industry in accordance with the Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 [Act 4]
before the coming into operation of the proposed Act shall be deemed to have
registered its industry under the proposed Act on the date the proposed Act
comes into operation.

21. _Clause 17_ seeks to provide that an employee shall be deemed to have

22. _Clause 18_ seeks to provide that the contributions payable under the

proposed Act in respect of an employee shall comprise a contribution payable

specified in Part I of the Second Schedule to the proposed Act. _Clause 18_
also empowers the Minister, after taking into consideration the sustainability
of the Fund, to determine the rates of contribution to be in accordance with
the proposed Part I, Part II or Part III of the Second Schedule, as the case
may be, in every three years or more.


-----

86 _Bill_

_Clause 18_ also empowers the Minister to determine the minimum rate

of contribution based on the amount of the monthly wages of the employee
insured in accordance with the proposed Part I, Part II or Part III of the Second
Schedule, as the case may be, and the minimum rate of benefits based on the
amount of the assumed monthly wages of the employee insured in accordance
with the proposed Part I, Part II or Part III of the Third Schedule, as the case
may be.

23. _Clause 19 seeks to provide that if an employee has two or more employers,_

every employer shall pay the contributions in respect of the employee separately.

24. _Clause 20_ seeks to provide that contribution in respect of an employee

28. _Clause 24 seeks to prohibit an employer from reducing the wages of any_

employee, or discontinuing or reducing benefits payable to the employee under
the conditions of service solely by reason of his liability for any contributions
payable under the proposed Act. Any employer who contravenes this provision
commits an offence.

29. _Clause 25 seeks to empower the Organization to appoint agents to collect_

and receive payment of contributions on behalf of the Organization. Clause 25
also imposes a duty on the agents appointed to inform the Organization the
actual time and date of the payment of the contributions made by the employer

evidence in support of the claim as prescribed.

33. _Clause 28_ seeks to require an application for claim for benefits to the

Organization to be submitted by an insured person within sixty days from the
date the insured person considers that he has lost his employment.

34. _Clause 29_ empowers the Organization to determine the date on which

date on which the insured person has lost his employment, as determined by
the Organization, the claim shall be rejected and the claim for benefits shall
be deemed to have never been made.

35. _Clause 30_ seeks to provide for the circumstances in which loss of

employment occurs. _Clause 30_ also seeks to provide for the meaning of
voluntary resignation.

36. _Clause 31_ seeks to make provisions for the Organization to determine

any question or disputes on whether loss of employment has occurred.

37. _Clause 32 seeks to empower the Organization to determine whether the_

insured person fulfils the contribution qualifying conditions as specified in the
Fourth Schedule to the proposed Act and the insured person has not attained
the minimum retirement age, on the date he lost his employment.

38. _Clause 33_ seeks to empower the Organization to approve or reject the

claim for benefits after considering the contribution qualifying conditions.
_Clause 33_ also empowers the Organization to determine the relevant benefits
to be provided to the insured person once his claim for benefits has been
approved.

39. _Clause 34_ seeks to provide that if the claim for benefits in respect of

an insured person has been approved, the insured person shall be entitled to
the job search allowance at the rate as specified in the Third Schedule to
the proposed Act and for the period which shall be in accordance with the
contributions qualifying conditions in respect of the claim for benefits by the
insured person as specified in the Fourth Schedule to the proposed Act, and
the payment for the job search allowance shall be made immediately after the
waiting period that is the period of seven days from the date of the approval
of claim for benefits.

_Clause 34 also seeks to provide that the payment for the job search allowance_

shall continue to be paid to the insured person though the insured person has
attained the minimum retirement age if the loss of employment occurs before
he attains the minimum retirement age. _Clause 34_ makes provisions on the
prohibition of an insured person to be in any employment during the period of
receiving the job search allowance and if an insured person accepts an offer of
employment during the period of receiving the job search allowance, he shall
notify the Organization within seven days from the date of acceptance of the
offer of employment. Contravention of these proposed provisions constitute
an offence.


-----

88 _Bill_
