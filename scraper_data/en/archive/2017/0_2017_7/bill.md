EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Labuan Business Activity Tax Act 1990
(“Act 445”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act._

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 21 of Act 445 to provide specifically the_
penalty of a fine not exceeding one million ringgit or imprisonment for a term
not exceeding two years or both for any contravention or failure to comply
with any regulations made under Act 445. At present, the penalty provided
in section 27 of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 [Act 388] which is
a fine not exceeding one thousand ringgit or imprisonment for a term not
exceeding six months or both applies. Thus, this amendment will provide the
same penalty for offences under Act 445 and offences under the regulations
made under Act 445.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN(U2)3067]
