EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Judges’ Remuneration Act 1971 (“Act 45”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 45 to provide that the period_
during which a Judge had served in another capacity under section 8c shall
be counted as the period of service as a Judge for the purpose of computing
a Judge’s pension.


-----

4 _Bill_

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend subsection 5(2) of Act 45 arising from the_
proposed amendment to section 8c.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to amend paragraph 8(c) of Act 45 to enable a Judge to
resign from his office at any age without losing his pension rights provided
he has held the office of a Judge for a continuous period of not less than
five years. The amendment further seeks to make it clear that the period of
continuous service of not less than five years includes the period he served
as a Judicial Commissioner immediately before his appointment as a Judge.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to substitute section 8c of Act 45 to extend the powers of_
the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to require a Judge to serve in another capacity at
any age either without relinquishing his office of a Judge or by relinquishing
his office as a Judge. In such circumstances where a Judge is required to
serve in another capacity in the national interest, the remuneration to which
the Judge is entitled under this Act during the period he serves in such other
capacity shall be paid by the body where he serves in such other capacity. If
he is required to relinquish his office as a Judge and is not reappointed as a
Judge, he will be deemed to have served as a Judge until the age of sixty-six
years and retires pursuant to paragraph 8(a) of Act 45.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
