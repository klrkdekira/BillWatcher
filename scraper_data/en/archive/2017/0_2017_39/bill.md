EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Care Centres Act 1993 (“Act 506”).

_2. Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act and empowers the_
Minister to appoint the date of coming into operation of the Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 506 to amend the definition of
“resident” to exclude the care of persons sixty years of age and above who
would be catered for under the Private Aged Healthcare Facilities and Services
Act 2017 [Act ].

4. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 506 to provide that Act 506
shall not apply to any private aged healthcare facilities and services licensed
under the Private Aged Healthcare Facilities and Services Act 2017.

_Care Centres (Amendment)_ 3

_5. Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new section_ 11b into Act 506 to allow
an operator of a registered care centre to admit persons sixty years of age
and above as persons received for care at the registered care centre and
such admittance shall be based on the criteria as may be prescribed by the
Minister. The new section 11b corresponds with section 43 of the Private Aged
Healthcare Facilities and Services Act 2017 to allow flexibility of care based
on the criteria prescribed by the Minister for instance to cater for spouses
to receive care at the same facility which would not be possible due to the
specified age limit if not for the arrangement under the new section 11b.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN(U2)3021]
