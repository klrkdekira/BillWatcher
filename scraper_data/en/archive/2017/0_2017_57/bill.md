EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (“Act 234”).

1. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend subsection 39b(2) of Act 234. Under the existing_
Act 234, any person convicted with the offence of trafficking in dangerous
drugs shall be punished with death. Section 39b was first inserted into Act 234
_vide the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act 1975 [Act A293] which came_
into operation on 30 April 1975. The amendment provided that a person
convicted with the offence of trafficking in a dangerous drug shall be punished
with death or with life imprisonment in which case he shall also be liable to
whipping. Subsequently, the sentence provided under section 39b of Act 234
was amended to provide for the mandatory death penalty _vide the Dangerous_
Drugs (Amendment) Act 1983 [Act A553]. This amendment came into operation
on 15 April 1983.

The proposed amendment also seeks to revert to the position prior to the

enactment of Act A553, whereby clause 2 seeks to amend subsection 39b(2) of
Act 234 to empower a Court to impose a punishment of death or imprisonment
for life and whipping of not less than fifteen strokes for the offence of drug
trafficking. However, in imposing the punishment of imprisonment for life and
whipping of not less than fifteen strokes, the Court may have regard only to


-----

4 _Bill_

any of the circumstances specified in the proposed new paragraph 39b(2a)
_(a),_ _(b) or_ _(c) and the Court shall have regard to a certification in writing_
by the Public Prosecutor that in the Public Prosecutor’s determination the
person convicted under subsection 39b(2) has assisted an enforcement agency
in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Malaysia.

Assistance to an enforcement agency in disrupting drug trafficking activities

may include, for example, the provision of information leading to the arrest,
detention or prosecution of any person involved in any drug trafficking activity.
With the proposed amendment, without the Public Prosecutor’s certification in
writing, the Court cannot exercise its powers to sentence a convicted person
to imprisonment for life and whipping of not less than fifteen strokes, even
though the circumstances specified in the proposed new paragraph 39b(2a)
_(a),_ _(b) or_ _(c) exist._

4. _Clause 3 provides for transitional provision. The provisions of the_
proposed Act shall apply to any person who has been charged but has not
been convicted under section 39b of the principal Act by a competent Court
on the commencement of the proposed Act. The new proposed amendment
to section 39b of Act 234 is not applicable to cases on appeal, whereby such
cases will have to go through the existing due process.

_ILLUSTRATION_

_A, has been charged with an offence under section 39b of the Dangerous_
_Drugs Act 1952 on a date prior to the commencement of this proposed Act._
_The trial is ongoing and on the date the proposed Act comes into operation,_
_A has yet to be convicted. Thereafter, if the Court convicts A, the proposed_
_new section 39b shall apply._

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN(U2)3096]
