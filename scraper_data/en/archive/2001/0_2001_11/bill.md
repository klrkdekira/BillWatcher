EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Postal Services Act 1991 ("the Act").

2. _Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title and commencement of the Bill._

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act. Among the significant_

amendments are the substitution of the definition of "authorized officer", the
introduction of the new definition of "Commission" and the deletion of the
definition of "Postal Department". The new definition of "authorized officer"
will enable any officer employed by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia
Commission ("Commission") to be authorized for the purposes of the Act. The

existing definitions of "Director General" and "Postal Department" have to be
deleted since with the Commission taking over the functions and duties of the
Director General of Post and the dissolution of the Postal Department, they are
no longer relevant.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to substitute section 4 of the Act with a new provision to,_

empower the Commission to perform the functions and duties under the Act


-----

10 _Bill_

and to give effect to the taking over, of the functions and duties of the Director
General of Post by the Commission. With the taking over the provision on the
appointment of the Director General of Post and other postal officers is no
longer necessary.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend the Act by deleting section 5. Under that section,_
the Director General of Post and all other officers of the Postal Department have
the powers and privileges conferred upon the Government under Part III of the
Act which deals with the privileges and protection of the Government in certain
postal matters. In view of the dissolution of the Postal Department and with
the Commission taking over the functions and duties under the Act, the provisions
contained in section 5 are no longer appropriate.

6. _Clause 6 seeks to amend subsections 6(1) and (2) of the Act. Subsection_
6(1) is amended by deleting paragraph (k). With this amendment the Director
General of Post will no longer carry out the function of representing the Government
in international postal services matters although such matters shall still remain
with the Government. The amendment to subsection 6(2) seeks to empower the
Commission to authorize the Chairman of the Commission and its authorized
officer to carry out the functions and duties set out in subsection 6(1) of the
Act.

7. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 9 of the Act to enable the Commission_
to be exempted from certain liabilities in carrying out its functions and duties
under the Act.

8. _Clause 10 seeks to delete to proviso to subsection 10(1) of the Act since_
it is no longer applicable. That proviso merely served as a transitional provision
when the Postal Department was corporatised in 1991.

9. Clause 12 seeks to amend section 15 of the Act to enable the Minister to
exempt the Government and its agencies from postal charges.

10. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 40 of the Act which contains provisions_
relating to the compounding of offences to bring them in line with the provisions
on the compounding of offences in the Communications and Multimedia Act
1998 [Act 588] which is also under the jurisdiction of the Commission.

11. _Clause 19 seeks to amend section 41 of the Act to empower the Minister_
to authorize any public officer or any officer of the Commission to exercise the
power of enforcement under the Act or its rules. Notwithstanding this, a police
officer not below the rank of Inspector may also exercise such power.

General with references to the authorized officers and officers authorized by
the Minister under section 41 of the Act, all of whom shall now be responsible
for conducting investigations and prosecutions under the Act.

13. _Clause 25 seeks to amend section 47 of the Act to provide that prosecution_

for offences under the Act or its rules may only be instituted by or with the
consent in writing of the Public Prosecutor.

14. _Clause 26 contains saving and transitional provisions to facilitate the_

taking over by the Commission from the Director General of Post and the Postal
Department of their functions under the Act.

15. Other amendments not specifically referred to are minor or consequential

in nature.

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
