provisions are essentially intended to facilitate the consolidation exercise involving
capital market intermediaries pursuant to the government's objective of further

words "where there was no such requirement before the commencement of this
Act" are only applicable to paragraph 165(4)(c) of the Act.

7. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.
