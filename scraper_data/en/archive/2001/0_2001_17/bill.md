**Power to order maintenance without appointing committee**

**71. If it appears to the Court, having regard to the situation and**
condition in life of the mentally disordered person and his family
and other relevant circumstances of the case, to be expedient that
his property should be made available for his or their maintenance
in a direct and inexpensive manner, the Court may, instead of
appointing a committee of the estate, order that the property, if
money, or, if of any other description, the produce thereof when
realized, be paid to such person as the Court may deem fit to
appoint to be applied for the maintenance of the mentally disordered
person and his family and all payments so made shall be a good
discharge to the person making the payment.

#### Temporary provision for maintenance

**72. If it appears to the Court that the incapability of a mentally**
disordered person to manage himself and his affairs is temporary
in nature, and that it is expedient to make temporary provision for
his maintenance or the maintenance of his family, the Court may,
in like manner as under section 71, direct that his property or a
sufficient part of the property be applied for that purpose.

**Order for reception of mentally disordered person**

**73. (1) Where upon an inquiry under this Part a person is found**
by the Court to be incapable of managing himself and his affairs
due to his mental disorder but the Court does not appoint a committee
of his person, the Court shall make an order for the person to be
received into a government psychiatric hospital or a gazetted private
psychiatric hospital and send him in suitable custody, together
with the order for his reception, to the psychiatric hospital named
in the order.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), if a friend or relative of the
mentally disordered person satisfies the Court that he undertakes
to take proper care of the person and prevent him from injuring
himself or others, the Court may, instead of making an order under
the subsection, make an order handing him over to the care of the
friend or relative.

_(b) on the application of a person acting on his behalf; or_

_(c) on the information of any other person,_

that there is reason to believe that such incapability has ceased,
the Court may make an order for an inquiry to determine whether
#### the person is now capable of managing himself and his affairs.

(2) The inquiry under subsection (1) shall be conducted in the
same manner as that prescribed for an inquiry into whether a
person alleged to be mentally disordered is incapable of managing
himself and his affairs.

that the person is now capable of managing himself and his affairs
the Court shall order all proceedings in the matter to cease or to
be set aside on such terms and conditions as it deems proper.

#### himself and his affairs

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend and consolidate the existing laws on mentally disordered
persons and to make new and better provisions relating to their admission, care,
treatment, rehabilitation, the control and protection of such persons, and for
other related matters.

2. The laws which this Bill seeks to replace are the Mental Disorders Ordinance
1952 [Ord. 3111952], the Mental Health Ordinance 1961 [Sarawak Ord.
_16/1961] and the Lunatics Ordinance 1951 [Sabah Ord. Cap. 74]._

PART I

3. Part I of the Bill deals with preliminary matters.

4. Clause 1 seeks to empower the Minister to appoint the date for the coming
into operation of the proposed Act.

5. Clause 2 contains the definitions of words and expressions used in this Bill.

6. _Clauses 3 and 4 seek to provide for the appointment of government psychiatric_
hospitals and gazetted private psychiatric hospitals.

7. Clauses 5 and 6 seek to provide for the appointment of Medical Directors
as persons in charge, and Deputy Medical Directors, of psychiatric hospitals.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to require the licensee and Medical Director of a private_
psychiatric hospital to comply with the requirements of the Private Healthcare
Facilities and Services Act 1998 [Act 586].

PART II

9. Part II contains provisions on the admission, detention, care, treatment,
rehabilitation, control and protection of mentally disordered persons and the
discharge of voluntary patients from psychiatric hospitals.

10. _Clause 8 sets out the various ways in which a person may be admitted_
into a psychiatric hospital.

11. _Clause 9 deals with the admission and discharge of voluntary patients into_
and from psychiatric hospitals, and the procedure involved. A voluntary patient
may also be granted leave of absence from the psychiatric hospital.

12. Clause 10 deals with the admission of an involuntary patient into a psychiatric
hospital on an application of a relative of the person. The clause spells out the
various medical examinations an involuntary patient will have to undergo at
different periods to determine whether his admission or detention which may
extend from one month to three months is justified or otherwise. The medical


-----

64 _Bill_

examinations act as a safeguard for the person to ensure either the continuance
of his medical treatment if he is still mentally disordered, or his discharge if
his further detention is unjustified.

13. _Clause 11 seeks to empower any police officer or social welfare officer_
to apprehend any suspected mentally disordered person and to produce him for
examination at a government or gazetted private psychiatric hospital.

14. _Clause 12 seeks to empower the Court, when dealing with offences under_

for medical examination at a government psychiatric hospital or gazetted private
psychiatric hospital if they are suspected to be mentally disordered and not
under any proper care and control.

15. _Clause 13 deals with cases of neglect or cruel treatment of a suspected_
mentally disordered person. A Magistrate may order a person who is legally
bound to maintain a suspected mentally disordered person to take that person
under his care and treatment. In the absence of such person the suspected
mentally disordered person may be sent to a government psychiatric hospital
or a gazetted private psychiatric hospital. The clause seeks to enable the Magistrate
to monitor the condition of the suspected mentally disordered person under the
care of the person legally bound to care for the mentally disordered person by
requiring visits to be made to him by any medical officer or registered medical
practitioner, any police officer not below the rank of Inspector, or any social
welfare officer.

16. _Clause 14 deals with the admission of a suspected mentally disordered_
person under clause 11, 12 or 13, or that of a mentally disordered person under
_clause 73, into a psychiatric hospital. The clause seeks to specify the medical_
examinations which the suspected mentally disordered person must undergo at
various periods of his admission and detention with a view to securing either
his discharge or continued detention for care or treatment for a period ranging
from one month to three months.

PART III

17. Part III deals with matters relating to the discharge, leave of absence and
transfer of involuntary patients from psychiatric hospitals.

18. _Clause 15 seeks to confer power on a Medical Director of a psychiatric_
hospital to discharge an involuntary patient who is not in need of any further
care or treatment.

19. Under Clause 16, an involuntary patient or his relative may apply for his
discharge. A person aggrieved with the Medical Director's refusal to grant his
discharge may appeal to the Visitors and henceforth to the Director General.


-----

_Mental Health_ 65

20. _Clause 17 seeks to empower a Medical Director to grant leave of absence_
or further leave to an involuntary patient each for a period not exceeding one
month, or to revoke such leave and require the patient to return to the psychiatric
hospital.

21. _Clause 18 seeks to provide for the apprehension of an involuntary patient_
who absents himself from the psychiatric hospital without leave or whose leave
of absence has been revoked under clause 17.
