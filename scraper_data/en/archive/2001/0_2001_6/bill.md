evidence of any agent provocateur shall not be illegal and no such
conviction shall be set aside merely because the court which tried
the case has failed to refer in the grounds of its judgment to the
need to warn itself against the danger of convicting on such evidence.

**Standard of proof**

**70. (1) Any question of fact to be decided by a court in proceedings**
under this Act shall be decided on the balance of probabilities.

_Anti-Money Laundering_ 61

**Admissibility of documentary evidence**

**71. Where the Public Prosecutor or any enforcement agency has**
obtained any document or other evidence in exercise of his powers
under this Act or by virtue of this Act, such document or copy of
the document or other evidence, as the case may be, shall be
admissible in evidence in any proceedings under this Act,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any written law.

**Admissibility of statements by accused persons**

**72. (1) In any trial or inquiry by a court into an offence under this**
Act, any statement, whether the statement amounts to a confession
or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before
or after the person is charged and whether in the course of an
investigation or not and whether or not wholly or partly in answer
to questions, by an accused person to or in the hearing of an officer
of any enforcement agency, whether or not interpreted to him by
any other officer of such enforcement agency or any other person,
whether concerned or not in the arrest of that person, shall,
notwithstanding any law or rule of law to the contrary, be admissible
at his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a
witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and
for the purpose of impeaching his credit.

(2) No statement made under subsection (1) shall be admissible

or used as provided for in that subsection if the making of the
statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement,
threat or promise having reference to the charge against the person,
proceeding from a person in the enforcement agency and sufficient
in the opinion of the court to give that person grounds which
would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it
he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal
nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

(3) Where any person is arrested or is informed that he may be

prosecuted for any offence under this Act, he shall be served with
a notice in writing, which shall be explained to him, to the following
effect:

"You have been arrested/informed that you may be prosecuted
for .... (the possible offence under this Act). Do you wish to


-----

62 _Bill_

say anything? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely
in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now.
If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may
be less likely to be believed and this may have an adverse
effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact
now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.".

(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), a statement by any person

accused of any offence under this Act made before there is time
to serve a notice under that subsection shall not be rendered
inadmissible in evidence merely by reason of no such notice having
been served on him if such notice has been served on him as soon
as is reasonably possible after the statement is made.

(5) No statement made by an accused person in answer to a

written notice served on him pursuant to subsection (3) shall be
construed as a statement caused by any inducement, threat or
promise as is described in subsection (2), if it is otherwise voluntary.

(6) Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an

offence under this Act, evidence is given that the accused, on
being informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention
any such fact, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at
the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when
so informed, the court, in determining whether the prosecution has
made out a prima facie case against the accused and in determining
whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw
such inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure
may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable
of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given against the
accused in relation to which the failure is material.

(7) Nothing in subsection (6) shall in any criminal proceedings—

_(a) prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or_

other reaction of the accused in the face of anything said
in his presence relating to the conduct in respect of which
he is charged, in so far as evidence of it would be admissible
apart from that subsection; or

_(b) be taken to preclude the drawing of any inference from_

any such silence or other reaction of the accused which
could be drawn apart from that subsection.

### Admissibility of statements and documents of persons who are dead or cannot be traced, etc.

**73. Notwithstanding any written law to the contrary, in any**
proceedings against any person for an offence under this Act—

_(a) any statement made by any person to an officer of any_

enforcement agency in the course of an investigation
under this Act; and

_(b) any document, or copy of any document, seized from any_

person by an officer of any enforcement agency in exercise
of his powers under this Act,

shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings under this Act

before any court, where the person who made the statement or the
document or the copy of the document is dead, or cannot be traced
or found, or has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose
attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or
expense which appears to the court unreasonable.

### Admissibility of translation of documents

**74. (1) Where any document which is to be used in any proceedings**
against any person for an offence under this Act is in a language
other than the national language or English language, a translation
of such document into the national language or English language
shall be admissible in evidence where the translation is accompanied

by a certificate of the person who translated the document setting

out that it is an accurate, faithful and true translation and the
translation had been done by such person at the instance of the
Public Prosecutor or an officer of any enforcement agency.

(2) Subsection (1) shall apply to a document which is translated,

regardless whether the document was made in or outside Malaysia,
or whether the translation was done in or outside Malaysia, or
whether possession of such document was obtained by the Public
Prosecutor or an officer of any enforcement agency in or outside
Malaysia.

### Proof of conviction and acquittal

**76. (1) For the purposes of any proceedings under this Act, the**
fact that a person has been convicted or acquitted of an offence
by or before any court in Malaysia or by a foreign court shall be
admissible in evidence for the purpose of proving, where relevant
to any issue in the proceedings, that he committed or did not
commit that offence, whether or not he is a party to the proceedings,
and where he was convicted whether he was so convicted upon
plea of guilt or otherwise.

(2) The court shall accept the conviction referred to in subsection

(1) as conclusive unless—

determined;

### Anti-Money Laundering 85

of property of any person suspected of committing a money laundering offence.

49. _Clause 44 provides that where an enforcement agency has reasonable_

grounds to suspect that a money laundering offence is being committed, it may
seize any property of the person committing the offence. When a freeze order
has been issued, the person may not deal with the property. The clause sets out
the ancillary powers that an enforcement agency may need with respect to its
power to freeze. The freeze order is intended to allow property to be frozen to
prevent it from being dissipated, removed, etc.

50. _Clauses 45 and 46 contain specific provisions relating to the seizure of_

movable property.

51. _Clause 47 provides that a judge of the High Court may order an advocate_

financial institutions in view of their specialised nature. This clause also makes
it clear that financial institutions can provide the information without being
liable for breaching banking secrecy obligations.

53. _Clause 49 seeks to empower the Public Prosecutor to require any person_

suspected of committing an offence under the Act and his relatives or associates
to give all details of their property. The clause also indemnifies a person who

institutions not to deal with movable property, including monetary instruments
which are the subject-matter of a money laundering offence.

and all the necessary ancillary powers to effect such a seizure.

in relation to a business. Those provisions include the power to run the business.

to a judge of a foreign State to prohibit the person holding the property from
dealing with it where the property that is subject to seizure is located overseas.

58. _Clause 54 provides that any dealing in the property after it is seized under_

this Part is void.

subject-matter of a money laundering offence. The court can forfeit such property


-----

86 _Bill_

where it is satisfied that an offence is proved against the accused or, where the
offence is not proved, that the accused is not the lawful owner and there is no
purchaser in good faith. This is to ensure that all property that is used in the
commission of a money laundering offence is forfeited and therefore money
launderers do not benefit from their crime especially as money laundering
offences are difficult to prove. If the offence is proved against the accused but
the property to be forfeited has been disposed of then the accused shall pay an
amount to the property's equivalent value as fine. The standard of proof required
in determining whether the property is the subject-matter of a money laundering
offence is on the balance of probabilities.

60. _Clause 56 seeks to empower the Public Prosecutor, where there is no_

prosecution or conviction for an offence, to apply to a court for the forfeiture
of any property that he is satisfied has been obtained as result of, or in connection
with, such offence. If there is no conviction or forfeiture, the property seized
shall be released to the person from whom it was seized. This is to ensure that
even if there is no conviction but the court is certain that property has been
obtained as a result of the offence the money launderers do not enjoy the
benefits of their crimes.

61. _Clause 57 provides that the validity of any seizure or sale of property shall_

not be affected by any objection relating to the form and manner it was effected.

62. _Clause 58 provides that any property forfeited shall vest with the Federal_

Government and provides the necessary powers to effect such vesting.

63. _Clause 59 seeks to allow the court to grant a pecuniary penalty order_

against a person from whom property was forfeited if he had derived benefits
from the commission of a money laundering offence.

64. _Clause 60 provides for the release by an investigating officer of any_

property seized by an enforcement agency where he is satisfied that such
property is not liable to forfeiture under the Act.

65. _Clause 61 seeks to require a notice to be given of an order of forfeiture_

so that a third party claiming a legitimate interest in the property may appear
in support of his claim. The court shall return the property seized or forfeited
where the person has a legitimate legal interest in the property.

66. _Clause 62 provides for the manner in which forfeited property may be_

disposed of. This clause empowers the Federal Government to retain it for
official use or sell it.

67. _Clause 63 contains special provisions relating to any person against whom_

an investigation for a serious offence has been commenced and who dies or who
cannot be found. Such person shall be treated as if he had been convicted of
the serious offence and this clause provides for his property to be forfeited.

68. _Clause 64 provides that a forfeiture order may be made on an absconded_

person if the court is satisfied that the person has absconded if the evidence


-----

_Anti-Money Laundering_ 87

shows a prima facie case. This clause ensures that property used in the commission
of a money laundering offence would be forfeited even if the money launderers
have absconded or have died.

69. _Clause 65 provides that an action in relation to an absconded person who_

dies shall be brought against the personal representatives and the forfeiture
order shall be made against the deceased's estate.

70. _Clause 66 seeks to enable the court to dispense with the service of documents_

on absconders.

PART VII

71. Part VII contains provisions relating to miscellaneous matters.

72. _Clause 67 seeks to empower the relevant enforcement agency to order any_

document, or information to be produced to it where it has reason to believe
that an offence is being committed or has been committed or is about to be
committed.

73. _Clause 68 provides that the powers of the relevant competent authority_

and the relevant enforcement agency under the Act shall be in addition to the
powers that the competent authority and enforcement agency have under any
other law.

74. _Clause 69 provides that an agent provocateur's evidence shall be credible_

and a conviction based solely on the uncorroborated evidence of an agent
provocateur shall not be illegal.

75. _Clause 70 provides that the standard of proof on a question of fact shall_

be on the balance of probabilities unless it is a question of fact in any criminal
proceeding for an offence under the Act.

76. _Clause 71 provides for the admissibility of documentary evidence._

77. _Clause 72 provides for the admissibility of the statements of an accused_

as evidence for any proceedings under this Act.

78. _Clause 73 provides for the admissibility of the statement of a person who_

is dead or cannot subsequently be traced as evidence.

79. _Clause 74 contains provisions for the admissibility of translation of_

documents.

80. _Clause 75 provides for the admissibility of documents issued by the_

evidence that he has committed or has not committed the offence, as the case
may be.
