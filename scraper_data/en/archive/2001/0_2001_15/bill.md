an additional function for the State Planning Committee.


-----

28 _Bill_

7. _Clause 9 seeks to amend subsection 5(2) of Act 172 to provide that the_
State Director of Town and Country Planning shall be the local planning authority
in respect of any area in a State which does not form part of the area of any
local authority.

8. Clause 11 seeks to introduce new Parts I I A and II B into Act 172. The new
Part II A provides for the establishment and functions of a regional planning
committee for a region which consists of an area situated in two or more
States. The new Part IIB requires the Director General of Town and Country
Planning to prepare a draft national physical plan and submit it for the approval
of the National Physical Planning Council.

9. Clauses 12,13,14 and 15 seek to amend sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 respectively
of Act 172 to provide that the draft structure plan which is now prepared by
individual local planning authorities for their respective areas shall now be
prepared for the whole State by the State Director of Town and Country Planning.
In addition to the matters required by the existing provisions of Act 172, the
draft structure plan must contain matters which are specified by the National
Physical Planning Council apart from those specified by the State Planning
Committee, and must also contain measures for the improvement of the physical
living environment, the improvement of communications, the management of
traffic, the improvement of socio-economic well being and the promotion of
economic growth, as well as measures for facilitating sustainable development.
The amendments to section 10 of Act 172 also proposes that in considering
whether to approve or reject a draft structure plan, the State Planning Committee
must consult the National Physical Planning Council for its direction and advice.
It is also proposed that the power of the State Authority under subsection
10(5) of Act 172 to decide on a draft structure plan if the State Planning
Committee fails or neglects to approve or reject the plan within six months
of its submission to the Committee be given to the Council.

10. _Clause 16 seeks to amend section 11 of Act 172 to provide for the_
review and alteration of a structure plan, while clause 16 proposes the introduction
into Act 172 of new sections I I A and I I B which contain the procedure for
such review and alteration.

authority to prepare a draft local plan for its own area as soon as practicable
after a structure plan for the State has come into effect.

planning authority to submit a draft local plan to the State Planning Committee

provisions of section 15, a local plan comes into effect upon its adoption by
the local planning authority. Under clause 20, it is also proposed that if there


-----

_Town and Country Planning (Amendment)_ _29_

exists a difference in the provisions of a local plan and the structure plan for
the State, the State Authority may declare that the local plan prevails over the
structure plan if it is satisfied that the difference is in fact due to the structure
plan being out of date.

14. _Clause 21 seeks to introduce new sections I6_ A and 16B into Act 172.
The new section 16A empowers the State Planning Committee to direct the
State Director of Town and Country Planning to prepare, alter, repeal or replace
a local plan where the local planning authority has failed to do so. The new
section 16B provides for the designation of a special area within the State for
which a special plan having the effect of a local plan may be prepared.

15. _Clause 22 seeks to introduce a new section 20A which requires every_
Federal and State Government department or agency to consult the State Planning
Committee as regards to any proposed development activity within the respective
States.

16. _Clause 23 seeks to amend section 21 of Act 172 to introduce the concept_
of "neighbouring lands". Owners of such land must be notified of their right
to object to an application for planning permission. The existing provision
provides such right to owners of adjoining lands only.

17. _Clause 24 seeks to amend section 21A of Act 172 so that the State_
Authority may require that for certain categories of development an analysis
of the social implications of the development must be incorporated in the
development proposal report.

18. _Clause 25 seeks to amend section 22 of Act 172 so that certain types_

be required referred by the State Planning Committee to the National Physical
Planning Council for its advice.

19. _Clauses 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33 and 34 seek to amend sections 26,_
27, 28, 29, 30, 35A, 35E and 35H respectively of Act 172 to increase the
penalties for offences committed under those sections. Such penalties now
include terms of imprisonment.

20. _Clause 31 seeks to introduce a new section 3l_ A to provide that the
development plan shall prevail over a building by-law if an inconsistency
exists between them.

21. _Clause 35 seeks to amend section 36 of Act 172 to enable the State_
Authority to appoint suitable persons with suitable qualifications and experience
in addition to the qualifications and experience now specified in paragraph
36(2)(a) to be the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Appeal Board.

22. _Clause 36 seeks to amend subsection 38(1) of Act 172 to provide that_
the special area plan provided under the new section 16B shall be the proper

shall be to the extent of the inconsistency be void.

permissions or appeals against the refusal of the local planning authority to
grant planning permission or against any condition imposed by the local planning
authority upon granting planning permission.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

of which cannot at present be ascertained.

**Amendment of Eleventh Schedule**

**14. The Eleventh Schedule to the Federal Constitution is amended**

by deleting the section number "46" and all words relating to that

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to make several amendments to the Federal Constitution.

2. _Clause 2 of this Bill seeks to amend Clause (3) of Article 6 of the Federal_

Constitution to provide that work or service which is required to be performed
in consequence of a conviction in a court of law shall not be taken to be forced
labour for the purpose of that Article if it is carried out under the supervision
and control of a public authority. The existing provisions only provide that
work incidental to the serving of a sentence of imprisonment shall not be taken
to be forced labour.

3. Under Article 8 of the Federal Constitution there can be no discrimination
against citizens on the grounds of religion, race, descent and place of birth
unless otherwise authorised by the Constitution. The amendment proposed in
_clause 3 of this Bill seeks to add gender to those grounds._

4. According to the existing provisions in the Federal Constitution, if a Senator

dies or ceases to hold office before the expiry of the term for which he is
elected or appointed, the person who is elected or appointed to replace him
may only hold office for the remainder of the term of office of the person he
replaces. The amendments proposed in clauses 4 and 13 of this Bill seek to
enable a person who is so elected or appointed to hold office for a period of
three years, that is the full term of office of a Senator.

5. The posts of Deputy President of the Senate and Deputy Speaker of the

House of Representatives are at present not full time posts. In view of the
increasing workload that they have to perform it is proposed, in clauses 5 and
_6 of this Bill that the posts be made full time._


-----

6 _Bill_

_6._ The Clerk to the Senate and Clerk to the House of Representatives are

appointed from among members of the general public service of the Federation
and they cease to hold office when they attain the age of 55 years, which is
the retirement age of members of the general public service. It is proposed,
in clause 1 of this Bill, that the reference to the age of 55 years in Clause
(2) of Article 65 be changed so that they cease to hold office when they attain
the age of compulsory retirement for members of their service. This will avoid
the necessity of amending that Article in future should the age of compulsory
retirement for members of the public service be changed.

7. _Clause 8 of this Bill seeks to amend Clause (1) of Article 114 of the_

Federal Constitution to increase the number of members of the Election
Commission. At present, the Commission consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and three other members. With the proposed amendment the Commission
will consist of a chairman, a deputy chairman and five other members.

8. Clause 9 of this Bill seeks to add a new paragraph (c) to Clause (1) of
Article 119 of the Federal Constitution to make it clear that a person must
be registered as an elector in the constituency in which he resides on the
qualifying date before he can vote in an election. Under the proposed Clause

(1A). if the electoral roll for the constituency is published in the Gazette, the
inclusion of a person in the electoral roll will be conclusive evidence that he
or she is properly registered in the roll. Clause 9 also seeks to make changes
to the definition of "qualifying date" in Clause (4) of Article 119 so that the
qualifying date is no longer the date by reference to which the electoral rolls
are prepared or revised but instead the date on which a person applies for
registration or change of registration as an elector in a constituency.

9. _Subclaitse 10(1) of this Bill seeks to replace the title "Chief of the Armed_

Forces Staff, which appears in the list of the members of the Armed Forces
Council in paragraph (3)(c) of Article 137 of the Federal Constitution, with
the title "Chief of Defence Forces" as the latter is the title being used now.
_Sitbclause 10(2) of this Bill deals with references to the "Chief of the Armed_
Forces Staff in other written laws. Subclause 10(3) of this Bill seeks to validate
any action that might have been taken using the title "Chief of Defence Forces"
before the proposed amendment comes into operation.

10. _Clause 11 of this Bill seeks to introduce a new Article 160A into the_

Federal Constitution.

At the moment, the Federal Constitution is reprinted from time to time

under the authority of the Commissioner of Law Revision pursuant to the
Revision of Laws Act 1968. However, in view of the status of the Federal
Constitution as the supreme law of the Federation, it is only proper that specific
provision for such reprint be included in the Constitution itself. Clause 11 also
contains provisions which will allow a copy reprinted under the Revision of
Laws Act 1968 to continue to be the authentic text of the Federal Constitution
until superseded by a copy reprinted under the proposed Article 160A.


-----

_Constitution (Amendment) (No. 2) 7_

11. _Clause 12 of this Bill seeks to introduce a new Article 160B into the_
Federal Constitution. The proposed new Article 160B will enable the Yang
di-Pertuan Agong to prescribe the national language translation of the Federal
Constitution to be the authoritative text.

12. The inclusion of section 46 of the Interpretation and General Clauses Act
1948 in the Eleventh Schedule to the Federal Constitution has the effect of
making the English language text of the Federal Constitution authoritative.
_Clause 14 of this Bill seeks to delete that section from the Eleventh Schedule_
in view of the proposed inclusion of Article 160B.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
