of the Board as provided for in section 90A".

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Lembaga Letrik Sabah Act 1983 ("Act 278").

2. _Clause 2 seeks to introduce a new section 90A into Act 278 to empower_
the Minister to make an order vesting the property, rights and liabilities of the
Lembaga Letrik Sabah in a person to be specified by the Minister in that order.
The vesting will take effect on the date appointed by the Minister in the order.
This clause also seeks to introduce a new section 90B into Act 278 to allow
the person in whom the property, rights and liabilities are vested to seek a Court
order to give effect to the vesting in that person of all or any of the alienated
lands, or any share or interest in such lands, in Sabah belonging to the Lembaga
Letrik Sabah.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 91 of Act 278 so that the vesting of the_
property, rights and liabilities of the Lembaga Letrik Sabah under the proposed
section 90A can become a ground for the dissolution of the Lembaga Letrik
Sabah.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
