6 _Bill_

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The proposed amendment to the Penal Code ("the Code") seeks to incorporate
into the Code certain offences relating to prostitution and immoral activities
occasioned by the repeal of the Women and Girls Protection Act 1973 ("the
repealed Act").

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the commencement date of the proposed_
Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to substitute section 372 of the Code. The offences described
in the proposed subsection (1) are basically similar to the offences set out in
section 16 of the repealed Act but will cover the prostitution and immoral
activities of both men and women. Penalties for such offences have been greatly
enhanced so as to commensurate with the offence committed since the penalties
imposed under the repealed Act and the existing section 372 are considered
manifestly inadequate. The sentence of whipping is proposed to be made mandatory.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to introduce new sections 372A and 372B into the Code._
These provisions are based on similar provisions as in sections 19 and 22 of
the repealed Act. The new section 372A prohibits any person from living on
or trading in prostitution while the new section 372B prohibits the activities of
soliciting for purposes of prostitution regardless of whether it is done in public
or private places. Penalties for such offences have also been enhanced with
mandatory term of imprisonment being proposed for an offence under section
372A.

5. Clause 4 seeks to substitute section 373 of the Code, aimed at suppressing
the establishment and management of brothels. Such provision is basically
similar to the provision of section 21 of the repealed Act but sees an increase
in the penalty which may be imposed. The offences provided in the existing
section 373 have been incorporated into the proposed paragraph 312(l)(a).

6. _Clause 5 seeks to delete section 373A of the Code as the offences provided_
for in that section have been incorporated into the proposed paragraphs 372(l)(b)
and (d).

_7._ _Clause 6 seeks to introduce new sections 376A and 378B into the Code._
These provisions are proposed to create the offence of incest. The new section
376A defines the offence of incest, whereas, the new subsection 376B(1) provides
the punishments for the offence, i.e., imprisonment for a term of not less than
six years and not more than twenty years, and shall be liable to whipping. For
the protection of victims of this offence, subsection 376B(2) provides specific
defences against a charge for this offence.

8. Other amendments not specifically referred to in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN(U[2])2240]
