This Bill seeks to amend the Co-operative Societies Act 1993 ("Act 502").

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the Bill._

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 83 of Act 502 in order to facilitate the_
enforcement of awards made by the tribunal by the Sessions Court. This clause
also seeks to introduce new subsections (6A) and (6c) into section 83 to respectively
provide for the procedure and power for the enforcement of the award in the

enable an award made before the date of commencement of the proposed
amendment to be enforced within a period of six years from the date of such
commencement instead of the date the award was made.

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
