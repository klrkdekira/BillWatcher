clearer and stricter provision on the collection and disclosure of credit information
by the credit bureau. With this amendment, the credit bureau may collect credit
information, including information on the issuance of bad cheques, on a customer
of a banking institutions and other financial institutions. The collection of credit

subsection (5A) into section 51 of the Act. With this amendment, non-compliance
