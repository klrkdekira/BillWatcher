EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to provide for a new Act to replace the Films (Censorship) Act
1952 ("Act 35"). The proposed Act is substantially similar to Act 35. However,
it is felt that a new Act is more appropriate to accommodate the amendments
proposed to Act 35.

2. The Bill is divided into eight parts.

3. Part I contains the short title, commencement and non-application provisions
as well as definitions of certain terms used in the Bill.

4. Part II contains provisions for the establishment of the Board of Censors.

5. Part III contains provisions on the control of films and film-publicity
materials.

_Clause 5 seeks to prohibit, amongst other things, the possession, exhibition_
and production of obscene films and film-publicity materials. The punishment
proposed is a fine of not less than ten thousand ringgit and not more than fifty
thousand ringgit or imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years
or to both. Under Act 35, a person who has in his possession any obscene film
is only liable, upon conviction, to a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit or
to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.


-----

_Film Censorship_ 35

_Clause 6 seeks to prohibit, among other things, the exhibition and distribution_

of films or film-publicity materials which have not been approved by the Board
of Censors. The punishment proposed for any person who contravenes this
prohibition is, in the case of a film, a fine of not less than five thousand ringgit
and not more than thirty thousand ringgit or imprisonment for a term not
exceeding three years or to both. In the case of a film-publicity material, the
punishment proposed is a fine of not less than one thousand ringgit and not

more than ten thousand ringgit. Under Act 35, the punishment for exhibiting
or distributing a film which has not been approved by the Board for exhibition
or distribution is a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit, and the punishment
for displaying or distributing a film-publicity material which has not been
approved for display or distribution is a fine not exceeding two thousand
ringgit.

_Clause 7 deals with imported film. It is proposed that such films be detained_

and may only be released upon presentation of a permit or a certificate of
exemption issued by the Board. Clause 8 contains provisions on the issuance
of the permit and the certificate of exemption.

_Clauses 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16 and 17 deal with the submission of films for_

censorship, decisions which the Board can make after viewing a film submitted
for censorship, the alterations to be made to a film which is approved for
exhibition subject to such alterations being made, the issuance of certificates
of approval for films, the classification of films, the duplication of approved
films and the issuance of certificates for duplicate copies of films, respectively.
_Clauses 10 and 11 also apply, as provided under clause 19 to film-publicity_
materials.

_Clauses 12 and 13 seek to permit the Board to retain films which are not_

approved by it and to dispose of the films after a period of three months or,
if there is an appeal to the Appeal Committee, if the Appeal Committee affirms
the decision of the Board in not approving the films.

_Clause 18 seeks to require the owner of a film to affix on the film the Board's_

mark of approval, and to display the certificate and classification of the film
as well as the name and address of the person who exhibits, distributes, displays
or sells the film. Clause 20 contains similar requirements in relation to filmpublicity materials.

6. Part IV contains clause 21 which permits appeals to be made to the Appeal

Committee from the decision of the Board of Censors. The establishment and
powers of the Appeal Committee are provided for in clauses 22 and 23 in the
same Part.

7. Part V contains powers of the Minister. It is proposed that the Minister be

empowered —

_(a) to issue general directions on matters of policy to the Board and the_

Appeal Committee (clause 25);

if the acts are contrary to public interest (clause 26);

_(c) to make any regulations which are necessary or expedient for the_
carrying out of the provisions of the proposed Act (clause 27); and

_(d) to grant exemptions from the provisions of the proposed Act or regulations_
made under it (clause 28).

8. Part VI contains provisions relating to enforcement.

Under clause 29, Enforcement Officers may be appointed and under clause
_30 they are empowered to investigate offences against the proposed Act. When_
so demanded by the person against whom such power is being exercised, an
Enforcement Officer must produce his authority card. The issuance of such card
is provided for in clause 31.

_Clauses 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 contain an Enforcement Officer's_
power to carry out search and seizure with a warrant issued by a Magistrate,
to carry out such search and seizure without such warrant in certain circumstances,
to seize films and film-publicity materials which have been or are likely to be
used in the commission of an offence under the proposed Act, to make arrests,
to require any person who appears to be acquainted with the circumstances of
a case to attend before the Enforcement Officer and to examine such person,
respectively.

_Clause 40 seeks to permit an order for the forfeiture of any thing seized_
under the proposed Act to be made by the court before which the prosecution
with regard to the thing is held, or, if there is no such prosecution, after the
procedure set out in the clause has been complied with.

Under clause 41, the costs of holding any thing in the custody of the Government
will be a debt due to the Government by the person found guilty of an offence
under the proposed Act in relation to such thing.

_Clause 42 seeks to provide that no person may recover any costs or damages_
due to the seizure of any thing under the proposed Act unless the seizure is made
without reasonable cause.

9. Part VII contains miscellaneous matters.

_Clause 43 seeks to provide that prosecution of offences under the proposed_
Act may only be instituted by or with the consent of the Public Prosecutor.

_Clause 44 seeks to confer jurisdiction on a court of a First Class Magistrate_
to impose the maximum punishment as proposed under this Act notwithstanding
that subsection 87(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act 1948 permits a First Class
Magistrate to only pass a sentence not exceeding a fine of ten thousand ringgit
and imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

_Film Censorship_ 37

_Clause 45 deals with offences committed by a body corporate._

_Clause 46 contains provisions relating to the compounding of offences._

name or address of the owner of the film.

_Clause 48 seeks to provide that any decision of the Minister, the Board of_
Censors or the Appeal Committee under the proposed Act cannot be the subject
of any appeal or review by any court.

_Clause 49 seeks to deem members of the Board of Censors and the Appeal_
Committee, among others, to be public servants within the meaning of the Penal
Code. Under clause 50, they are also given immunity from legal action in
respect of acts done by them in good faith for the purposes of implementing
the proposed Act.

Under clause 51, the Board and the Government will not be liable for the
loss of or damage to any film submitted to the Board for approval, except for
wilful damage caused by the Board or its officers or staff.

_Clause 52 seeks to permit the Board to dispose of any film in its possession_
which has remained unclaimed for more than two years.

10. Part VIII contains repeal, transitional and savings provisions.

Act 35 is repealed (clause 53) and the Board and Committees established
under Act 35 are dissolved (clause 54). However, pending matters before the
Board and Committees must be disposed of by them as if they had not been
dissolved and Act 35 had not been repealed.

under Act 35.
