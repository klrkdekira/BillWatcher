_alia, specifying the persons who may be present at the place where the live_
link facilities are available and in the courtroom.

9. _Clause 6 provides for the evidence of a child witness by way of video_

recording. The video recording of the child witness shall be admitted as
evidence-in-chief during a proceeding but shall subject to the Evidence

recording upon the issuance of a certificate by a person who recorded the
video.

a child witness pursuant to clause 6, who attains the age of sixteen years

shall not influence the answer of the child witness or disrupt the questioning
of the child witness.

child witness is giving evidence in the Court. The adult accompanying the

give his evidence in any other manner apart from the manner as set out in
_clause 3 and such evidence is to be deemed oral evidence._

a child witness if while giving evidence the child witness attains the age of

sixteen years.


17. _Clause 14 seeks to restrict the media reporting and publication of the_

of the child witness. It also provides for the penalty for non-compliance with
this provision.

19. _Clause 15 seeks to empower the Minister to make regulations._


20. _Clause 16 seeks to provide for the Evidence Act 1950 [Act 56] and the_

of which cannot at present be ascertained.
