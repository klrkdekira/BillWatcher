EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the National Land Code 1965 (“the Code”) which
includes the insertion of a new Sixteenth Schedule to enable the introduction
and the usage of an electronic land administration system in Peninsular
Malaysia.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 5 of the Code to introduce new definitions_
and to amend existing definitions of certain terms used in the Code consequent
upon amendments proposed in the Bill.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 5B of the Code to empower the Minister_
to make any amendments to the Fourteenth Schedule. The present provision
only enables the Minister to amend the forms in that Schedule.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new PART ONE (C) into the Code which will_
facilitate the implementation of the Electronic Land Administration System.
Among others, it empowers the Minister to appoint different dates for the
coming into operation of the Electronic Land Administration System in any
land Registry. The Minister is also empowered to make any amendments to
the Sixteenth Schedule by an order.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend paragraph 14(1)(i) of the Code to enable the_
State Authority to appoint collecting agents to accept payment for any item
of land revenue.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend paragraph 62(2)(c) of the Code to clarify that_
the officers appointed to have the control of any reserved land shall be public
officers.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend subsection 80(3) of the Code to enable the_
Registrar to issue a final title in respect of a land without first issuing a
qualified title.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend paragraph 81(1)(d) of the Code to provide for fees_
chargeable in connection with the preparation and registration of documents
of qualified title and final document of title or final document of title.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 92D of the Code to clarify that the State_
Authority may entertain an application from the proprietor of any alienated land
for the independent use or alienation of underground land below the alienated
land only after any rent payable in respect of the land has been paid.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend paragraph 124(4)(c) to insert the words “or_
restriction in interest”. These words should have been incorporated when
amendments were made to section 124 vide Act A587 which came into operation
on 25 March 1985. This _clause is proposed to be given a retrospective effect_
to that date.


-----

# National Land Code (Amendment) 47

12. _Clause 11 seeks to introduce a new paragraph (ca) into subsection 136(1)_
of the Code. The new paragraph creates a new condition that must be satisfied
before an application for subdivision is approved, namely, the proprietor of
the land has agreed to surrender such part of the land to be used for public
purposes, the use of which has been approved by the appropriate planning
authority.

13. _Clause 12 seeks to introduce a new subsection (3) into section 140 of_
the Code to enable the co-proprietors of alienated land to partition the land
which is subject to the category of “agriculture” or to any condition requiring
its use for an agricultural purpose. The said land is two-fifths of a hectare,
more or less than two-fifths of a hectare. The application for partition which
is less than two-fifths of a hectare requires approval by the State Authority.

14. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 141 of the Code consequent upon the_
amendment made to section 140.

15. _Clause 14 seeks to replace section 141A of the Code. The new section_
141A enables any co-proprietor to apply for partition of the land without
having to take into consideration the proportion of his share in the land.

16. _Clause 15 seeks to introduce a new subsection (5) into section 142 which_
relates to the submission by the Land Administrator to the State Authority of
any application to partition land made pursuant to section 143A.

17. _Clause 16 seeks to introduce a new section 143A into the Code which will_
enable the State Authority to entertain applications for partition of agriculture
land subject to restrictions under subparagraph 136(1)(f)(i) of the Code and
provides the procedure thereof.

18. _Clause 17 seeks to amend section 147 of the Code consequent upon the_
amendment made to subsection 136(1).

19. _Clause 18 seeks to introduce a new subsection (1A) into section 204GA_
which allows the Land Administrator to cancel or cause to be cancelled the
