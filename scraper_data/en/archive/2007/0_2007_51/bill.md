EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Special Complaints Commission Act 2007 ("the Act") as proposed by this Bill
contains provisions for the establishment of the Special Complaints Commission,
to set out the powers and functions of such Commission, and to provide for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto. This Bill is introduced as a result of the
recommendations made by the Royal Commission to Enhance the Operation and
Management of the Royal Malaysia Police and it is intended to cover not only the
police officers but also all enforcement officers at the Federal level.

PART I

2.  Part I of the Act contains preliminary matters.

_Clause 1_ deals with the short title and seeks to allow the Prime Minister to

appoint the date of commencement of the Act. The Act applies only to complaints
of misconduct committed by any enforcement officer on or after the
commencement of the Act. By _subclause (4),_ the complaint must relate to
misconduct committed whilst performing his official duties.

_Clause 2 contains the definitions of certain expressions used in the Act._

PART II

3.  Part II contains provisions relating to the Special Complaints Commission ("the
Commission").

_Clauses 3 and 4 seek to provide for the establishment of the Commission and_

constitution of the Commission.

_Clause 5 contains provision on the tenure of office for certain members of the_

Commission whilst clause 6 provides for the payment of allowances to members of
the Commission.

_Clause 7_ sets out the circumstances where a member of the Commission may

exercise the functions of the Chairman.

_Clause 8_ pertains to the revocation of appointment of certain members of the

Commission and their resignation.

_Clause 9_ spells out the circumstances in which office of a member of the

Commission becomes vacant.

_Clause 10 seeks to provide for the protection of any member of the Commission_

from incurring personal liability for any loss or damage caused by any act or
omission in administering the affairs of the Commission, unless the said loss or
damage was occasioned by an intentional wrongful act or omission on his part.


-----

**32** _Bill_

_Clause 11 applies the Schedule to members of the Commission._

_Clause 12 seeks to provide for the delegation of the Commission's functions and_

powers.

_Clause 13 seeks to enable the Commission to establish committees to assist in_

the performance of its functions.

_Clause 14_ seeks to impose a duty on every enforcement agency to co-operate

and assist the Commission in performing its functions and exercising its powers
under the Act.

PART III

4.  Part III contains provisions relating to the functions and powers of the
Commission.

_Clause 15_ spells out the functions and powers of the Commission, which

includes receiving complaints from any person in relation to misconduct of an
enforcement officer and the manner the Commission shall deal with the complaints.

PART IV

5.  Part IV contains provisions on dealing with complaints by the Commission.

_Clause 16_ contains provisions on how the Commission deals with the

complaints it receives. _Subclause_ (/) requires the Commission to consider any
complaint lodged with it. Subclauses (2) and (3) describe the nature of complaints
not to be considered by the Commission. By _subclause (3),_ the Commission is
required to cease considering any complaint if the complaint becomes the subject
matter of any investigation. By virtue of _subclause (4),_ the Commission is
empowered to dismiss a complaint that is frivolous and vexatious and devoid of
merit. Subclause (5) provides that if a complaint bears merit, the Commission shall,
if the complaint discloses a misconduct of disciplinary nature, refer the complaint
to the appropriate Disciplinary Authority for further action. This is described in
paragraph (a). Paragraphs (b) and (c) specify the nature of a misconduct that need
to be referred to the Task Force of the Commission and to the appropriate
enforcement agency. Subclauses (6) and (7) require the Commission to inform the
complainant of such referral, be it to the appropriate Disciplinary Authority or the
enforcement agency. It is made clear by these provisions that the Commission is not
to indulge in matters that should appropriately be dealt with by a Disciplinary
Authority or an enforcement agency so as not to dilute conduct of powers conferred
on it by any written law. _Subclause (8)_ provides that upon completion of the
investigation referred to in _subclause (3),_ the Public Prosecutor is obliged to
communicate his decision on the investigation to the Commission. It also spells out
the necessary actions required to be taken by the Commission in relation thereto.


-----

_Special Complaints Commission_ 33

_Clause 17_ seeks to empower the Commission to conduct a preliminary

investigation for the purposes of determining the merit of a complaint.

_Clauses 18_ and _19_ impose a duty on the Disciplinary Authority or the

enforcement agency to which a complaint has been referred to by the Commission,
to submit a monthly report on the progress of the disciplinary proceeding or
investigation. The Disciplinary Authority or the enforcement agency may be
required to explain why the progress of the disciplinary proceeding or investigation
undertaken by it is unsatisfactory. _Subclause 18(3)_ requires the Disciplinary
Authority to inform the Commission of the decision made at the end of disciplinary
proceedings while _subclause 19(3)_ makes similar requirement to the enforcement
agency. Despite the fact that the Commission have no linkage to the procedures
undertaken by the Disciplinary Authority and the conduct of criminal investigation
by the enforcement agency, _clauses 18_ and _19_ ensure that the Commission still
exercises close oversight over the Disciplinary Authority and enforcement agency
in handling the complaints from the public. The requirement so imposed also will
ensure effective monitoring of complaints by the Commission.

_Clause 20_ requires the Task Force to submit the investigation papers or any

other document to the Commission upon completion of an investigation for the
next course of action to be taken pursuant to clause 22.

Task Force to conduct further investigation on a complaint.

discloses that there is a misconduct on the part of an enforcement officer.

case may be, to communicate its decision to the Commission within thirty days
from the date of receipt of the investigation papers.

_Clause 24_ places a duty on the Commission to inform the complainant of its

decision where the complaint is not substantiated following an investigation. The
Commission shall also communicate the decision to the complainant after the
complaint has been referred to the Disciplinary Authority or the Public Prosecutor.
