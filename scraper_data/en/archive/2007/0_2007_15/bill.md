_Bill_

(2) Where an application for the registration of any document

or instrument of hire purchase has been made and the process
of its registration is still pending immediately before the repeal
of the Ordinance, proceedings in respect of the said application
may be continued under the repealed Ordinance.


(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), any fee paid for the

registration of any document or instrument of hire purchase, shall
not be refunded.

(4) For the purposes of subsection 10(2), sections 11 and 12

of the Ordinance, upon the repeal of the Ordinance under section
2, the Registrar shall, subject to the provisions of the Sarawak
State Library Ordinance 1999 (Chapter 29), retain a copy of the
registered document or instrument of hire purchase and within
six months from the date of the repeal submit such documents to
the State Depository established under Part IV of Chapter 29.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to repeal the Hire Purchase Registration Ordinance,
(Chapter 71), which was enacted in 1934 and which is applicable to the State
of Sarawak only. With the coming into operation of the Hire-Purchase Act
1967 (Act 212) throughout Malaysia, including Sarawak, on 11 April 1968,
the Ordinance is considered outdated and has since outlived its usefulness.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act._

3. _Clause 2 seeks to repeal the Ordinance._

4. _Clause 3 seeks to provide savings and transitional provisions._

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.

[PN(U[2])1990]
