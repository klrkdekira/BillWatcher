_2_ _Bill_

**Amendment of section 18**

**3. Section 18 of the principal Act is amended —**

_(a)_ by substituting for paragraph (l)(e) the following

paragraph:

_"(e)_ a part which shall contain all matter which is

required to be published in the _Gazette_ or which
the Government deems it necessary to publish for
general information other than matter which this
subsection requires to be published in the other
parts."; and

_(b)_ by  inserting  after  subsection  (3)  the following

subsection:

"(4) Where the _Gazette_ is published in more than one

form, the date of publication of the Gazette shall be deemed
to be the date the Gazette is first published in any form.".

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 ("Act 388").

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of the_

proposed Act.

3. _Subclause 2(a)_ seeks to redefine the word _"Gazette"._ By the proposed

amendment, the definition is expanded to include publication in electronic form or
in such other form as the Government may order.

4. Amendment to paragraph 18(1 _)(e)_ of Act 388 in _subclause 3(a)_ seeks to

remove specific requirements as to when publication of _Gazette_ Notification may
be made since the amendment to subclause 2(a) will lead to the implementation of
the _Gazette_ being published online. The new subsection (4) seeks to specify the
date of publication of Gazette when publication is made in more than one form.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount of
which cannot at present be ascertained.
