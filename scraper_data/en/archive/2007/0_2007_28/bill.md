EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Bills of Exchange Act 1949 ("Act 204") for the
purposes of implementing a cheque truncation system in Malaysia.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of_

the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to substitute section 74_ A to pave the way for the

implementation of the cheque truncation system.

The new section 74A allows a collecting bank to present a cheque for

payment to the paying bank by transmitting through electronic means, an
image and the electronic payment information of the cheque instead of the
cheque itself, but preserves the right for the paying bank to demand that the
cheque itself be presented.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to introduce new sections 74B and 74c into Act 204 relating_

to cheque truncation system.

The new section 74B requires the collecting bank to issue to the holder of

the cheque an image return document where the cheque is dishonoured by nonpayment, unless the collecting bank returns the cheque or the holder of the
cheque requests the return of the cheque. The image return document may be
presented for payment by the holder of the cheque to the collecting bank
which issued that document. The image return document will be deemed to
be a cheque for the purpose of such presentment.

The new section 74c empowers the Minister to make regulations in respect

of any matters relating to cheque truncation.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 86 to provide that sections 74A and 74B_

apply to instruments referred to in paragraph 85(2)(b) of Act 204 and section
74A applies to instruments referred to in paragraph 85(2)(c) of Act 204. An
instrument issued under paragraphs 85(2)(b) and 85(2)(c) which, though not a
bill of exchange, may be presented by transmitting through electronic means,
an image and the electronic payment information of the instrument. In the
event an instrument under paragraph 85(2)(b) is dishonoured by non-payment,
an image return document will be issued to the holder of such instrument.
However, the issuance of image return document under section 74B is not
applicable to instruments referred to in paragraph 85(2)(c). Examples of
instruments under paragraph 85(2)(b) are pension warrants and interest warrants.
Examples of instruments under paragraph 85(2)(c) are banker's cheques and
banker's acceptances.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This  B i l l  w i l l  not  involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
