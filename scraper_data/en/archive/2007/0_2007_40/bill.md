AMENDMENTS TO THE INCOME TAX ACT 1967

Chapter II of this Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1967.

2. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 3b of Act 53. Currently, an offshore
company is subject to the provisions of Act 445 in respect of its offshore
business activity. With the proposed amendment, an offshore company can
make an irrevocable election under section 3a of Act 445 to be taxed under
Act 53.

This amendment has effect for the year of assessment 2008 and subsequent

years of assessment.

3. _Clause 5 seeks to amend the proviso to subsection 5(1) of Act 53 as a_
consequence of the introduction of section 109e into Act 53. With the proposed
amendment, any income received by an individual from profits distributed or
credited by a takaful operator out of a family fund, family re-takaful fund or
general fund shall be excluded for the purpose of computing his chargeable
income.

This amendment has effect for the year of assessment 2008 and subsequent

years of assessment.

4. Clause 6 seeks to introduce a new paragraph 6(1)(j) into Act 53 to provide
that a participant is subject to tax on the income distributed or credited by a

for in that section or any other formula which is consistent with the generally
accepted accounting principles.
