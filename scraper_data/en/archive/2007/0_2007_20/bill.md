[Section 2]

MONTREAL PROTOCOL No. 4

TO AMEND THE CONVENTION FOR THE UNIFICATION OF CERTAIN

RULES RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL CARRIAGE BY AIR

SIGNED AT WARSAW ON 12 OCTOBER 1929

AS AMENDED BY THE PROTOCOL DONE AT THE HAGUE ON

28 SEPTEMBER 1955 SIGNED AT MONTREAL ON 25 SEPTEMBER 1975

CHAPTER I

SCOPE - DEFINITIONS

Article 1


(1) This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage

or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous
carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking.

(2) For the purposes of this Convention, the expression international

_carriage means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between_
the parties, the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not
there be a break in the carriage or a transshipment, are situated either within
the territories of two High Contracting Parties or within the territory of a
single High Contracting Party if there is an agreed stopping place within the
territory of another State, even if that State is not a High Contracting Party.
Carriage between two points within the territory of a single High Contracting
Party without an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State
is not international carriage for the purposes of this Convention.


-----

_Carriage By Air (Amendment)_

(3) Carriage to be performed by several successive air carriers is deemed,

for the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has
been regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed
upon under the form of a single contract or a series of contracts, and it does
not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of
contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.

Article 2

(1) This Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally

constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in Article 1.

(2) In the carriage of postal items, the carrier shall be liable only to the

relevant postal administration in accordance with the rules applicable to the
relationship between the carriers and the postal administrations.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this Article, the provisions of

this Convention shall not apply to the carriage of postal items.

CHAPTER II

DOCUMENTS OF CARRIAGE

SECTION 1

PASSENGER TICKET

Article 3

(1) In respect of the carriage of passengers a ticket shall be delivered

containing;

_(a)_ an indication of the places of departure and destination;

_(b)_ if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a

single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places
being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least
one such stopping place;

_(c)_ a notice to the effect that, if the passenger's journey involves an

ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the country of
departure, the Warsaw Convention may be applicable and that the
Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers
for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage to
baggage.

(2) The passenger ticket shall constitute prima facie evidence of the

conclusion and conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence, irregularity
or loss of the passenger ticket does not affect the existence or the validity of
the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to the rules of
this Convention. Nevertheless, if, with the consent of the carrier, the passenger
embarks without a passenger ticket having been delivered, or if the ticket does
not include the notice required by paragraph (1)(c) of this Article, the carrier
shall not be entitled to avail himself of the provisions of Article 22.


-----

# Bill

SECTION 2

BAGGAGE CHECK

Article 4

(1) In respect of the carriage of registered baggage, a baggage check shall

be delivered, which, unless combined with or incorporated in a passenger
ticket which complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph (1), shall
contain:

_(a)_ an indication of the places of departure and destination;

_(b)_ if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a

single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places
being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least
one such stopping place;

_(c)_ a notice to the effect that, if the carriage involves an ultimate destination

or stop in a country other than the country of departure, the Warsaw
Convention may be applicable and that the Convention governs and
in most cases limits the liability of carriers in respect of loss or
damage to baggage.

(2) The baggage check shall constitute prima facie evidence of the registration

of the baggage and of the conditions of the contract of carriage. The absence,
irregularity or loss of the baggage check does not affect the existence or the
validity of the contract of carriage which shall, none the less, be subject to
the rules of this Convention. Nevertheless, if the carrier takes charge of the
baggage without a baggage check having been delivered or if the baggage
check [unless combined with or incorporated in the passenger ticket which
complies with the provisions of Article 3, paragraph (1)(c)] does not include
the notice required by paragraph (1)(c) of this Article, he shall not be entitled
to avail himself of the provision of Article 22, paragraph (2).

SECTION 3

DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO CARGO

Article 5

(1) In respect of the carriage of cargo an air waybill shall be delivered.

(2) Any other means which would preserve a record of the carriage to

be performed may, with the consent of the consignor, be substituted for the
delivery of an air waybill. If such other means are used, the carrier shall, if
so requested by the consignor, deliver to the consignor a receipt for the cargo
permitting identification of the consignment and access to the information
contained in the record preserved by such other means.

(3) The impossibility of using, at points of transit and destination, the other

means which would preserve a record of the carriage referred to in paragraph
(2) of this Article does not entitle the carrier to refuse to accept the cargo for
carriage.


-----

_Carriage By Air (Amendment)_

Article 6

(1) The air waybill shall be made out by the consignor in three original

parts.

(2) The first part shall be marked "for the carrier"; it shall be signed by

the consignor. The second part shall be marked "for the consignee"; it shall
be signed by the consignor and the carrier. The third part shall be signed
by the carrier and handed by him to the consignor after the cargo has been
accepted.

(3) The signature of the carrier and that of the consignor may be printed

or stamped.


(4) If, at the request of the consignor, the carrier makes out the air waybill,

he shall be deemed, subject to proof to the contrary, to have done so on behalf
of the consignor.

Article 7

Where there is more than one package:

_(a)_ the carrier of the cargo has the right to require the consignor to make

out separate air waybills;

_(b)_ the consignor has the right to require the carrier to deliver separate

receipts when the other means referred to in paragraph (2) of Article
5 are used.

Article 8

The air waybill and receipt for the cargo shall contain:

_(a)_ an indication of the places of departure and destination;

_(b)_ if the places of departure and destination are within the territory of a

single High Contracting Party, one or more agreed stopping places
being within the territory of another State, an indication of at least
one such stopping place; and

_(c)_ an indication of the weight of the consignment.

Article 9

Non-compliance with the provisions of Articles 5 to 8 shall not affect the
existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall, none the
less, be subject to the rules of this Convention including those relating to
limitation of liability.

Article 10

(1) The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and

statements relating to the cargo inserted by him or on his behalf in the air
waybill or furnished by him or on his behalf to the carrier for insertion in
the receipt for the cargo or for insertion in the record preserved by the other
means referred to in paragraph (2) of Article 5.


-----

_Bill_

(2) The consignor shall indemnify the carrier against all damage suffered

by him, or by any other person to whom the carrier is liable, by reason of the
irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements
furnished by the consignor or on his behalf.

(3) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article, the

carrier shall indemnify the consignor against all damage suffered by him,
or by any other person to whom the consignor is liable, by reason of the
irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements
inserted by the carrier or on his behalf in the receipt for the cargo or in the
record preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph (2) of Article 5.

Article 11

(1) The air waybill or the receipt for the cargo is prima facie evidence

of the conclusion of the contract, of the acceptance of the cargo and of the
conditions of carriage mentioned therein.

(2) Any statements in the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo relating

to the weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating
to the number of packages, are prima facie evidence of the facts stated; those
relating to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute
evidence against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are
stated in the air waybill to have been, checked by him in the presence of the
consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo.

Article 12

(1) Subject to his liability to carry out all his obligations under the

contract of carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by
withdrawing it at the airport of departure or destination, or by stopping it in
the course of the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered
at the place of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other
than the consignee originally designated, or by requiring it to be returned to
the airport of departure. He must not exercise this right of disposition in such
a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and he must repay any
expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right.

(2) If it is impossible to carry out the orders of the consignor the carrier

must so inform him forthwith.

(3) If the carrier obeys the orders of the consignor for the disposition of

the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill or
the receipt for the cargo delivered to the latter, he will be liable, without
prejudice to his right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which
may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that
part of the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo.

(4) The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that

of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13. Nevertheless, if the
consignee declines to accept the cargo, or if he cannot be communicated with,
the consignor resumes his right of disposition.


-----

_Carriage By Air (Amendment)_

Article 13

(1) Except when the consignor has exercised his right under Article 12, the

consignee is entitled, on the arrival of the cargo at the place of destination,
to require the carrier to deliver the cargo to him, on payment of the charges
due and on complying with the conditions of carriage.

(2) Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice

to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives.

(3) If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not

arrived at the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to
have arrived, the consignee is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights
which flow from the contract of carriage.

Article 14

The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given
to them by Articles 12 and 13, each in his own name, whether he is acting
in his own interest or in the interest of another, provided that he carries out
the obligations imposed by the contract of carriage.

Article 15

(1) Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect the relations of the consignor and

the consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties whose
rights are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee.

(2) The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express

provision in the air waybill or the receipt for the cargo.

Article 16

(1) The consignor must furnish such information and such documents as

are necessary to meet the formalities of customs, octroi or police before the
cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor is liable to the carrier
for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency or irregularity of
any such information or documents, unless the damage is due to the fault of
the carrier, his servants or agents.

(2) The carrier is under no obligation to enquire into the correctness or

sufficiency of such information or documents.

CHAPTER III

LIABILITY OP THE CARRIER

Article 17

The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding
of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident
which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in
the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.


-----

_Bill_

Article 18

(1) The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction

or loss of, or damage to, any registered baggage, if the occurrence which
caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air.

(2) The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction

or loss of, or damage to, cargo upon condition only that the occurrence which
caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air.

(3) However, the carrier is not liable if he proves that the destruction,

loss of, or damage to, the cargo resulted solely from one or more of the
following:

_(a)_ inherent defect, quality or vice of that cargo;

_(b)_ defective packing of that cargo performed by a person other than the

carrier or his servants or agents;

_(c)_ an act of war or an armed conflict;

_(d)_ an act of a public authority carried out in connection with the entry,

exit or transit of the cargo.

(4) The carriage by air within the meaning of the preceding paragraphs

of this Article comprises the period during which the baggage or cargo is in
the charge of the carrier, whether in an airport or on board an aircraft or, in
the case of a landing outside an airport, in any place whatsoever.

(5) The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage

by land, by sea or by river performed outside an airport. If, however, such
carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for
the purpose of loading, delivery or transshipment, any damage is presumed,
subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which
took place during the carriage by air.

Article 19

The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of
passengers, baggage or cargo.

Article 20

In the case of passengers and baggage, and in the case of damage occasioned
by delay in the carriage of cargo, the carrier shall not be liable if he proves
that he and his servants and agents have taken all necessary measures to avoid
the damage or that it was impossible for them to take such measures.

Article 21

(1) In the carriage of passengers and baggage, if the carrier proves that

the damage was caused by or contributed to by the negligence of the person
suffering the damage the Court may, in accordance with the provisions of its
own law, exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability.


-----

_Carriage By Air (Amendment)_

(2) In the carriage of cargo, if the carrier proves that the damage was caused

by or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of
the person claiming compensation, or the person from whom he derives his
rights, the carrier shall be wholly or partly exonerated from his liability to
the claimant to the extent that such negligence or wrongful act or omission
caused or contributed to the damage.

Article 22

(1) In the carriage of persons the liability of the carrier for each passenger

is limited to the sum of 16,600 Special Drawing Rights. Where, in accordance
with the law of the court seised of the case, damages may be awarded in the
form of periodical payments, the equivalent capital value of the said payments
shall not exceed this limit. Nevertheless, by special contract, the carrier and
the passenger may agree to a higher limit of liability.

(2) _(a) In the carriage of registered baggage, the liability of the carrier_

is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless
the passenger or consignor has made, at the same time when the package
was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration or interest in delivery
at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In
that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared
sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater than the passenger's or the
consignor's actual interest in delivery at destination.


_(b) In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a sum_

of 17 Special Drawing Rights per kilogramme, unless the consignor has made,
at the same time when the package was handed over to the carrier, a special
declaration of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary
sum if the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a
sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves that that sum is greater
than the consignor's actual interest in delivery at destination.

_(c) In the case of loss, damage or delay of part of registered baggage or cargo,_

or of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration
in determining the amount to which the carrier's liability is limited shall be
only the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless,
when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the registered baggage or cargo,
or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered
by the same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total weight of such
package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in determining the
limit of liability.

(3) As regards objects of which the passenger takes charge himself the liability

of the carrier is limited to 332 Special Drawing Rights per passenger.

(4) The limits prescribed in this Article shall not prevent the court from

awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole or part of
the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the
plaintiff. The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages


-----

# Bill

awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not
exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within
a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage.
or before the commencement of the action, if that is later.

(5) The sums mentioned in terms of the Special Drawing Right in this

Article shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the
International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies
shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such
currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of judgment.

(6) The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right,

of a High Contracting Party which is a Member of the International Monetary
Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied
by the International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgment for
its operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms
of the Special Drawing Right, of a High Contracting Party which is not a
Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner
determined by that High Contracting Party. Nevertheless, those States which
are not Members of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not
permit the application of the provision of paragraph (2)(b) of Article 22 may,
at the time of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare that
the limit of liability of the carrier in judicial proceedings in their territories is
fixed at a sum of two hundred and fifty monetary units per kilogramme. This
monetary unit corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of

of liability constitute maximum limits and may not be exceeded whatever the
circumstances which give rise to the liability.

Article 25

In the carriage of passengers and baggage, the limits of liability specified in
Article 22 shall not apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act
or omission of the carrier, his servants or agents, done with intent to cause

or agents, in that case, shall not exceed the said limits.

(3) In the carriage of passengers and baggage, the provisions of paragraphs

condition and in accordance with the document of carriage.

(2) In the case of damage, the person entitled to delivery must complain

to the carrier forthwith after the discovery of the damage, and, at the latest,
within seven days from the date of receipt in the case of baggage and fourteen

on which the baggage or cargo has been placed at his disposal.

(3) Every complaint must be made in writing upon the document of carriage

or by separate notice in writing despatched within the times aforesaid.

his estate.

(1) An action for damages must be brought, at the option of the plaintiff,

in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, either before the court

by the law of the court seised of the case.

Article 30

(1) In the case of carriage to be performed by various succesive carriers

and falling within the definition set out in the third paragraph of Article 1,
each carrier who accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subjected to the
rules set out in this Convention, and is deemed to be one of the contracting
parties to the contract of carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part
of the carriage which is performed under his supervision.

(2) In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or his representative

can take action only against the carrier who performed the carriage during
which the accident or the delay occurred, save in the case where, by express
agreement, the first carrier has assumed liability for the whole journey.

(3) As regards baggage or cargo, the passenger or consignor will have a

right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who
is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and
further, each may take action against the carrier who performed the carriage
during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place. These carriers
will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or
consignee.

Article 30A

liable for damage in accordance with its provisions has a right of recourse
against any other person.

[Section 2]

THE MONTREAL CONVENTION, 1999

CONVENTION FOR THE UNIFICATION OF CERTAIN RULES

FOR INTERNATIONAL CARRIAGE BY AIR SIGNED
AT MONTREAL ON 28 MAY 1999

THE STATES PARTIES TO THIS CONVENTION

RECOGNIZING the significant contribution of the Convention for the Unification
of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air signed in Warsaw on
12 October 1929, hereinafter referred to as the "Warsaw Convention", and other
related instruments to the harmonization of private international air law;

RECOGNIZING the need to modernize and consolidate the Warsaw Convention
and related instruments;

RECOGNIZING the importance of ensuring protection of the interests of
consumers in international carriage by air and the need for equitable compensation
based on the principle of restitution;

REAFFIRMING the desirability of an orderly development of international
air transport operations and the smooth flow of passengers, baggage and


-----

_Carriage By Air (Amendment)_

cargo in accordance with the principles and objectives of the Convention on
International Civil Aviation, done at Chicago on 7 December 1944;

CONVINCED that collective State action for further harmonization and
codification of certain rules governing international carriage by air through a
new Convention is the most adequate means of achieving an equitable balance
of interests;

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

**CHAPTER I**

**GENERAL PROVISIONS**

**Article 1**

Scope of Application

1. This Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage

or cargo performed by aircraft for reward. It applies equally to gratuitous
carriage by aircraft performed by an air transport undertaking.

2. For the purposes of this Convention, the expression international carriage
means any carriage in which, according to the agreement between the parties,
the place of departure and the place of destination, whether or not there be
a break in the carriage or a transshipment, are situated either within the
territories of two States Parties, or within the territory of a single State Party
if there is an agreed stopping place within the territory of another State, even
if that State is not a State Party. Carriage between two points within the
territory of a single State Party without an agreed stopping place within the
territory of another State is not international carriage for the purposes of this
Convention.

3. Carriage to be performed by several successive carriers is deemed, for
the purposes of this Convention, to be one undivided carriage if it has been
regarded by the parties as a single operation, whether it had been agreed upon
under the form of a single contract or of a series of contracts, and it does
not lose its international character merely because one contract or a series of
contracts is to be performed entirely within the territory of the same State.

4. This Convention applies also to carriage as set out in Chapter V, subject
to the terms contained therein.

**Article 2**

Carriage Performed by State and Carriage of Postal Items

1. This Convention applies to carriage performed by the State or by legally

constituted public bodies provided it falls within the conditions laid down in
Article 1.

2. In the carriage of postal items, the carrier shall be liable only to the

relevant postal administration in accordance with the rules applicable to the
relationship between the carriers and the postal administrations..


-----

_Bill_

3.  Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this Article, the provisions of this
Convention shall not apply to the carriage of postal items.

3. The carrier shall deliver to the passenger a baggage identification tag for

each piece of checked baggage.

affect the existence or the validity of the contract of carriage, which shall,

1. In respect of the carriage of cargo, an air waybill shall be delivered.

2. Any other means which preserves a record of the carriage to be performed

may be substituted for the delivery of an air waybill. If such other means are

**Article 10**

Responsibility for Particulars of Documentation

1. The consignor is responsible for the correctness of the particulars and

or furnished by it or on its behalf to the carrier for insertion in the cargo
receipt or for insertion in the record preserved by the other means referred to

acting on behalf of the consignor is also the agent of the carrier.

irregularity, incorrectness or incompleteness of the particulars and statements
furnished by the consignor or on its behalf.

3. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the carrier

the carrier or on its behalf in the cargo receipt or in the record preserved by
the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4.

Article 11

conclusion of the contract, of the acceptance of the cargo and of the conditions
of carriage mentioned therein.

2. Any statements in the air waybill or the cargo receipt relating to the

weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the
number of packages, are prima facie evidence of the facts stated; those relating
to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence
against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are stated in the
air waybill or the cargo receipt to have been, checked by it in the presence
of the consignor, or relate to the apparent condition of the cargo.


-----

_Carriage By Air (Amendment)_

**Article 12**

Right of Disposition of Cargo

1. Subject to its liability to carry out all its obligations under the contract of

carriage, the consignor has the right to dispose of the cargo by withdrawing
it at the airport of departure or destination, or by stopping it in the course of
the journey on any landing, or by calling for it to be delivered at the place
of destination or in the course of the journey to a person other than the
consignee originally designated, or by requiring it to be returned to the airport
of departure. The consignor must not exercise this right of disposition in such
a way as to prejudice the carrier or other consignors and must reimburse any
expenses occasioned by the exercise of this right.

2. If it is impossible to carry out the instructions of the consignor, the carrier

must so inform the consignor forthwith.

3. If the carrier carries out the instructions of the consignor for the disposition

of the cargo without requiring the production of the part of the air waybill
or the cargo receipt delivered to the latter, the carrier will be liable, without
prejudice to its right of recovery from the consignor, for any damage which
may be caused thereby to any person who is lawfully in possession of that
part of the air waybill or the cargo receipt.

4. The right conferred on the consignor ceases at the moment when that

of the consignee begins in accordance with Article 13. Nevertheless, if the
consignee declines to accept the cargo, or cannot be communicated with, the
consignor resumes its right of disposition.

Article 13

Delivery of the Cargo

1. Except when the consignor has exercised its right under Article 12, the

consignee is entitled, on arrival of the cargo at the place of destination, to
require the carrier to deliver the cargo to it, on payment of the charges due
and on complying with the conditions of carriage.

2. Unless it is otherwise agreed, it is the duty of the carrier to give notice
to the consignee as soon as the cargo arrives.

3. If the carrier admits the loss of the cargo, or if the cargo has not arrived at

the expiration of seven days after the date on which it ought to have arrived,
the consignee is entitled to enforce against the carrier the rights which flow
from the contract of carriage.

**Article 14**

Enforcement of the Rights of Consignor and Consignee

The consignor and the consignee can respectively enforce all the rights given
to them by Articles 12 and 13, each in its own name, whether it is acting in
its own interest or in the interest of another, provided that it carries out the
obligations imposed by the contract of carriage.


-----

_Bill_

**Articles 15**

Relations of Consignor and Consignee or Mutual Relations of Third Parties

1. Articles 12, 13 and 14 do not affect either the relations of the consignor

and the consignee with each other or the mutual relations of third parties
whose rights are derived either from the consignor or from the consignee.

2. The provisions of Articles 12, 13 and 14 can only be varied by express

provision in the air waybill or the cargo receipt.

**Article 16**

Formalities of Customs, Police or Other Public Authorities

1. The consignor must furnish such information and such documents as are

necessary to meet the formalities of customs, police and any other public
authorities before the cargo can be delivered to the consignee. The consignor
is liable to the carrier for any damage occasioned by the absence, insufficiency
or irregularity of any such information or documents, unless the damage is
due to the fault of the carrier, its servants or agents.

2. The carrier is under no obligation to enquire into the correctness or

sufficiency of such information or documents.

CHAPTER III

LIABILITY OF THE CARRIER AND EXTENT OF COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE

**Article 17**

Death and Injury of Passengers - Damage to Baggage

1. The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of death or bodily

injury of a passenger upon condition only that the accident which caused the
death or injury took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the
operations of embarking or disembarking.

2. The carrier is liable for damage sustained in case of destruction or loss

of, or of damage to, checked baggage upon condition only that the event
which caused the destruction, loss or damage took place on board the aircraft
or during any period within which the checked baggage was in the charge
of the carrier. However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent that the
damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the baggage. In
the case of unchecked baggage, including personal items, the carrier is liable
if the damage resulted from its fault or that of its servants or agents.

3. If the carrier admits the loss of the checked baggage, or if the checked

baggage has not arrived at the expiration of twenty-one days after the date
on which it ought to have arrived, the passenger is entitled to enforce against
the carrier the rights which flow from the contract of carriage.

4. Unless otherwise specified, in this Convention the term "baggage" means

both checked baggage and unchecked baggage.


-----

_Carriage By Air (Amendment)_

**Article 18**

Damage to Cargo

1. The carrier is liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction

or loss of, or damage to, cargo upon condition only that the event which
caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air.

2. However, the carrier is not liable if and to the extent it proves that the
destruction, or loss of, or damage to, the cargo resulted from one or more of
the following:

_(a)_ inherent defect, quality or vice of that cargo;

_(b)_ defective packing of that cargo performed by a person other than the

carrier or its servants or agents;

_(c)_ an act of war or an armed conflict;

_(d)_ an act of public authority carried out in connection with the entry,

exit or transit of the cargo.

3. The carriage by air within the meaning of paragraph 1 of this Article
comprises the period during which the cargo is in the charge of the carrier.

4. The period of the carriage by air does not extend to any carriage by land,
by sea or by inland waterway performed outside an airport. If, however, such
carriage takes place in the performance of a contract for carriage by air, for
the purpose of loading, delivery or transshipment, any damage is presumed,
subject to proof to the contrary, to have been the result of an event which
took place during the carriage by air. If a carrier, without the consent of the
consignor, substitutes carriage by another mode of transport for the whole or
part of a carriage intended by the agreement between the parties to be carriage
by air, such carriage by another mode of transport is deemed to be within the
period of carriage by air.

**Article 19**

Delay

The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of
passengers, baggage or cargo. Nevertheless, the carrier shall not be liable for
damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and its servants and agents
took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or
that it was impossible for it or them to take such measures.

**Article 20**

Exoneration

If the carrier proves that the damage was caused or contributed to by the
negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation,
or the person from whom he or she derives his or her rights, the carrier shall
be wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the claimant to the extent
that such negligence or wrongful act or omission caused or contributed to
the damage. When by reason of death or injury of a passenger compensation


-----

_Bill_

is claimed by a person other than the passenger, the carrier shall likewise be
wholly or partly exonerated from its liability to the extent that it proves that
the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful
act or omission of that passenger. This Article applies to all the liability
provisions in this Convention, including paragraph 1 of Article 21.

Article 21

Compensation in Case of Death or Injury of Passengers

1. For damages arising under paragraph 1 of Article 17 not exceeding 100,000

Special Drawing Rights for each passenger, the carrier shall not be able to
exclude or limit its liability.

2. The carrier shall not be liable for damages arising under paragraph 1 of

Article 17 to the extent that they exceed for each passenger 100,000 Special
Drawing Rights if the carrier proves that:

_(a)_ such damage was not due to the negligence or other wrongful act or

omission of the carrier or its servants or agents; or

_(b)_ such damage was solely due to the negligence or other wrongful act

or omission of a third party.

**Article 22 Limits of Liability in**

Relation to Delay. Baggage and Cargo

1. In the case of damage caused by delay as specified in Article 19 in the

carriage of persons, the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited
to 4,150 Special Drawing Rights.

2. In the carriage of baggage, the liability of the carrier in the case of

destruction, loss, damage or delay is limited to 1,000 Special Drawing
Rights for each passenger unless the passenger has made, at the time when
the checked baggage was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration
of interest in delivery at destination and has paid a supplementary sum if
the case so requires. In that case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not
exceeding the declared sum, unless it proves that the sum is greater than the
passenger's actual interest in delivery at destination.

3. In the carriage of cargo, the liability of the carrier in the case of destruction,

loss, damage or delay is limited to a sum of 17 Special Drawing Rights per
kilogramme, unless the consignor has made, at the time when the package
was handed over to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at
destination and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires. In that
case the carrier will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum,
unless it proves that the sum is greater than the consignor's actual interest in
delivery at destination.

4. In the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay of part of the cargo, or

of any object contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in
determining the amount to which the carrier's liability is limited shall be only
the total weight of the package or packages concerned. Nevertheless, when


-----

_Carriage By Air (Amendment)_

the destruction, loss, damage or delay of a part of the cargo, or of an object
contained therein, affects the value of other packages covered by the same air
waybill, or the same receipt or, if they were not issued, by the same record
preserved by the other means referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 4, the total
weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in
determining the limit of liability.

5, The foregoing provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not

apply if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the
carrier, its servants or agents, done with intent to cause damage or recklessly
and with knowledge that damage would probably result; provided that, in the
case of such act or omission of a servant or agent, it is also proved that such
servant or agent was acting within the scope of its employment.

6. The limits prescribed in Article 21 and in this Article shall not prevent the

court from awarding, in accordance with its own law, in addition, the whole
or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred
by the plaintiff, including interest. The foregoing provision shall not apply if
the amount of the damages awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses
of the litigation, does not exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in
writing to the plaintiff within a period of six months from the date of the
occurrence causing the damage, or before the commencement of the action,
if that is later.

Article 23

Conversion of Monetary Units

1. The sums mentioned in terms of Special Drawing Right in this Convention

shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the
International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies
shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such
currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgment.
The value of a national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of
a State Party which is a Member of the International Monetary Fund, shall
be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the
International Monetary Fund, in effect at the date of the judgment, for its
operations and transactions. The value of a national currency, in terms of
the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a Member of the
International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by
that State.

2. Nevertheless, those States which are not Members of the International

Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provision
of paragraph 1 of this Article may, at the time of ratification or accession or at
any time thereafter, declare that the limit of liability of the carrier prescribed
in Article 21 is fixed at a sum of 1,500,000 monetary units per passenger in
judicial proceedings in their territories; 62,500 monetary units per passenger with
respect to paragraph 1 of Article 22; 15,000 monetary units per passenger with
respect to paragraph 2 of Article 22; and 250 monetary units per kilogramme
with respect to paragraph 3 of Article 22. This monetary unit corresponds to
sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred.


-----

_Bill_

These sums may be converted into the national currency concerned in round
figures. The conversion of these sums into national currency shall be made
according to the law of the State concerned.

3. The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of this
Article and the conversion method mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Article
shall be made in such manner as to express in the national currency of the
State Party as far as possible the same real value for the amounts in Articles
21 and 22 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of
paragraph 1 of this Article. States Parties shall communicate to the depositary
the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, or the result
of the conversion in paragraph 2 of this Article as the case may be, when
depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession
to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.

**Article 24**

Review of Limits

1. Without prejudice to the provision of Article 25 of this Convention and

subject to paragraph 2 below, the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 21,

22 and 23 shall be reviewed by the Depositary at five-year intervals, the first
such review to take place at the end of the fifth year following the date of
entry into force of this Convention, or if the Convention does not enter into
force within five years of the date it is first open for signature, within the
first year of its entry into force, by reference to an inflation factor which
corresponds to the accumulated rate of inflation since the previous revision
or in the first instance since the date of entry into force of the Convention.
The measure of the rate of inflation to be used in determining the inflation
factor shall be the weighted average of the annual rates of increase or decrease
in the Consumer Price Indices of the States whose currencies comprise the
Special Drawing Right mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 23.

2. If the review referred to in the preceding paragraph concludes that the

inflation factor has exceeded 10 per cent, the Depositary shall notify States
Parties of a revision of the limits of liability. Any such revision shall become
effective six months after its notification to the States Parties. If within three
months after its notification to the States Parties a majority of the States
Parties register their disapproval, the revision shall not become effective and
the Depositary shall refer the matter to a meeting of the States Parties. The
Depositary shall immediately notify all States Parties of the coming into force
of any revision.

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the procedure referred to in

paragraph 2 of this Article shall be applied at any time provided that one-third
of the States Parties express a desire to that effect and upon condition that the
inflation factor referred to in paragraph 1 has exceeded 30 per cent since the
previous revision or since the date of entry into force of this Convention if
there has been no previous revision. Subsequent reviews using the procedure
described in paragraph 1 of this Article will take place at five-year intervals
starting at the end of the fifth year following the date of the reviews under
the present paragraph.

falling within the definition set out in paragraph 3 of Article 1, each carrier
which accepts passengers, baggage or cargo is subject to the rules set out
in this Convention and is deemed to be one of the parties to the contract of
carriage in so far as the contract deals with that part of the carriage which is
performed under its supervision.

2. In the case of carriage of this nature, the passenger or any person entitled

to compensation in respect of him or her can take action only against the
carrier which performed the carriage during which the accident or the delay
occurred, save in the case where, by express agreement, the first carrier has
assumed liability for the whole journey.

right of action against the first carrier, and the passenger or consignee who
is entitled to delivery will have a right of action against the last carrier, and
further, each may take action against the carrier which performed the carriage
during which the destruction, loss, damage or delay took place. These carriers
will be jointly and severally liable to the passenger or to the consignor or
consignee.

CARRIER

**Article 39**

Contracting Carrier - Actual Carrier

The provisions of this Chapter apply when a person (hereinafter referred to
as "the contracting carrier") as a principal makes a contract governed by this
Convention with a passenger or consignor or with a person acting on behalf
of the passenger or consignor, and another person (hereinafter referred to as
"the actual carrier") performs, by virtue of authority from the contracting
carrier, the whole or part of the carriage, but is not with respect to such part
a successive carrier within the meaning of this Convention. Such authority
shall be presumed in the absence of proof to the contrary.

**Article 40**

Respective Liability of Contracting and Actual Carriers

If an actual carrier performs the whole or part of carriage which, according to
the contract referred to in Article 39, is governed by this Convention, both the
contracting carrier and the actual carrier shall, except as otherwise provided
in this Chapter, be subject to the rules of this Convention, the former for the
whole of the carriage contemplated in the contract, the latter solely for the
carriage which it performs.

**Article 41**

Mutual Liability

1. The acts and omissions of the actual carrier and of its servants and agents

acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the carriage
performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the contracting
carrier.

2. The acts and omissions of the contracting carrier and of its servants and
agents acting within the scope of their employment shall, in relation to the
carriage performed by the actual carrier, be deemed to be also those of the
actual carrier. Nevertheless, no such act or omission shall subject the actual
carrier to liability exceeding the amounts referred to in Articles 21, 22, 23
and 24. Any special agreement under which the contracting carrier assumes
obligations not imposed by this Convention or any waiver of rights or defenses
conferred by this Convention or any special declaration of interest in delivery
at destination contemplated in Article 22 shall not affect the actual carrier
unless agreed to by it.

**Article 42**

Addressee of Complaints and Instructions

Any complaint to be made or instruction to be given under this Convention
to the carrier shall have the same effect whether addressed to the contracting

_Bill_

carrier or to the actual carrier. Nevertheless, instructions referred to in Article
12 shall only be effective if addressed to the contracting carrier.

**Article 43**

Servants and Agents

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, any servant or agent
of that carrier or of the contracting carrier shall, if they prove that they acted
within the scope of their employment, be entitled to avail themselves of the
conditions and limits of liability which are applicable under this Convention
to the carrier whose servant or agent they are, unless it is proved that they
acted in a manner that prevents the limits of liability from being invoked in
accordance with this Convention.

**Article 44**

Aggregation of Damages

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, the aggregate of
the amounts recoverable from that carrier and the contracting carrier, and
from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment,
shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either
the contracting carrier or the actual carrier under this Convention, but none
of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit
applicable to that person.

**Article 45**

Addressee of Claims

In relation to the carriage performed by the actual carrier, an action for
damages may be brought, at the option of the plaintiff, against that carrier or
the contracting carrier, or against both together or separately. If the action is
brought against only one of those carriers, that carrier shall have the right to
require the other carrier to be joined in the proceedings, the procedure and
effects being governed by the law of the court seised of the case.

**Article 46**

Additional Jurisdiction

Any action for damages contemplated in Article 45 must be brought, at the
option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the States Parties, either before
a court in which an action may be brought against the contracting carrier, as
provided in Article 33, or before the court having jurisdiction at the place
where the actual carrier has its domicile or its principal place of business.

**Article 47**

Invalidity of Contractual Provisions

Any contractual provision tending to relieve the contracting carrier or the
actual carrier of liability under this Chapter or to fix a lower limit than that
which is applicable according to this Chapter shall be null and void, but the
nullity of any such provision does not involve the nullity of the whole contract,
which shall remain subject to the provisions of this Chapter.

rights and obligations of the carriers between themselves, including any right
of recourse or indemnification,

CHAPTER VI

OTHER PROVISIONS

Mandatory Application

applied, or by altering the rules as to jurisdiction, shall be null and void.

insurance covering its liability under this Convention.
