EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Small Estates (Distribution) Act 1955 (“Act
98”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint_
the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to make general amendment to Act 98. The word “Collector”_
is now replaced with the words “Land Administrator”.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 2 of Act 98. This amendment seeks to
introduce the definitions of “Corporation” and “valuation officer” into Act
98.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 98 to redefine the expression_
of “small estate” to mean property of a deceased person not exceeding two
million ringgit in total value, as distinct from its existing value of six hundred
thousand ringgit.

6. _Subclause 5(a) seeks to amend subsection 4(1) of Act 98 which deals with_
the jurisdiction of a Land Administrator in respect of small estate. Through this
amendment, the Land Administrator of the district where a petition has been
lodged, or if there is more than one petition, where the first petition has been
lodged, shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the distribution and
administration of the whole estate. Parties now may lodge their applications
for distribution to any Land Administrator without having to take into account
where the greater part in value of the estate is situated. The amendment to
subsection 4(5) in subclause 5(b) seeks to allow a valuation officer other than
the Land Administrator to determine the value of property comprised in an
estate. The proposed move will expedite valuation process.

6 _Bill_

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 8 of Act 98. The amendment to subsection_
(1) is in consequence of the amendment made to section 4 of Act 98. To
facilitate a filing of a petition, the proposed amendment to subsection (2) in
_subclause 6(b) will enable a petitioner to deliver to the Land Administrator_
any document evidencing title where the petitioner is unable to produce
the issue documents of titles. _Subclause (e)_ seeks to substitute subsection
(8). The new subsection (8) requires the Land Administrator to deal with a
petition for distribution of a small estate before him but he is also allowed to
transfer the petition to another Land Administrator if it appears to him that
it would be more expedient for the petition to be heard by the other Land
Administrator. Subclause 6(f) seeks to amend subsection (9) to refine and
clarify the provision.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 8A into Act 98 which requires_
the Corporation to deliver to the Land Administrator any document relating
to any movable property comprised in an estate that has been administered
or is being administered by the Corporation, for the purpose of determining
whether the estate is a small estate or otherwise.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend subsection 12(3) of Act 98 to provide for a Settlement_
Officer to be a witness in a hearing of a petition for distribution.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new section 13A into Act 98 to require_
the Land Administrator to accept any direction or declaration made by the
Corporation in relation to any movable property comprised in a small estate
that has been administered by the Corporation.

11. _Clause 10_ seeks to introduce a new subsection (5A) into section 15 of
Act 98 to confer the Land Administrator the discretion to sell any movable
property where two or more beneficiaries are entitled to a share in it. In
doing so, the Land Administrator shall have regard to the interest of those
concerned.

12. _Clause 12 seeks to provide for transitional provision._

13. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
