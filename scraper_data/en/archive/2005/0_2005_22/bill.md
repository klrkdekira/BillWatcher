_Judges' Remuneration (Amendment)_ 3

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Judges' Remuneration Act 1971 ("Act 45")
consequential to the amendment made to Clause (1) of Article 125 of the
Federal Constitution which has increased the age of retirement of a Judge from
sixty-five years to sixty-six years. Amendments proposed are to the definition
of "retirement" in section 1A and to section 8 of Act 45 as set out in clauses
_2_ and _3_ respectively. This Bill is given a retrospective effect to the date the
amendment to Article 125 came into operation.

For the avoidance of doubt, clause 4 provides for the preservation of entitlement

to a pension and other benefits under Act 45 of a Judge who has opted to retire
at the age of sixty-five years. Clause 5 seeks to validate the grant of pension
and other benefits granted to a Judge whose tenure of office was extended to
such period not later than six months after he has attained the age of sixty-five
years by virtue of Article 125 of the Federal Constitution.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN(U[2])2467]
