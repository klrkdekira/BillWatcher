AMENDMENTS TO THE INCOME TAX ACT 1967

Chapter II of this Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1967.

_2._ _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 25 of Act 53. New subsection (1A)_ is

introduced so that the gross income in respect of any right to acquire shares
in a company is taxed in the year where the right is exercised, assigned, released
or acquired.

This amendment will have effect for the year of assessment 2006 and subsequent

years of assessment.

_3._ _Clause 6 seeks to introduce new subsection (1A)_ into section 32 of Act 53.

The amendment seeks to provide the method to ascertain the gross income of
a person from an employment in respect of any right to acquire shares in a
company. The gross income shall consist of the market value of the shares at
the time the right is exercisable or the market value at the time the right is
exercised, whichever is the lower, less the amount paid for the shares.

This amendment will have effect for the year of assessment 2006 and subsequent

years of assessment.

4. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce into Act 53 new paragraph 44(1 )(e,) to allow_

a company to claim as a deduction, the adjusted loss of another related company
in arriving at its total income.

_Clause 9_ further seeks to introduce new subsections 44(5A), (5B) and (5c)

into Act 53. The amendments provide that any amount of loss ascertained for
a year of assessment under subsection 44(4) or (5) of Act 53 shall not be
available for deduction under section 43 of Act 53 if the shareholders of the
company in the year of assessment the amount is ascertained, were not substantially
the same with the shareholders of the company in the year of assessment the
loss would be available as a deduction under that section. The loss which is
not available for deduction will be disregarded for any subsequent years of
assessment.

_Clause 9_ also seeks to explain the meaning of "substantially the same" in

subsection 44(5B) and to provide that under special circumstances, the Minister
may exempt any company from the restriction imposed under the new subsection
44(5A) of Act 53.

_Clause 9_ further seeks to amend subsection 44(8) of Act 53 to allow as a

deduction any gift of money made on provision of library facilities and to public
libraries and libraries of schools and institutions of higher education.

These amendments will have effect for the year of assessment 2006 and

subsequent years of assessment.

5. _Clause 10 seeks to introduce a special provision relating to section 44 of_

Act 53.  This subsequent clause provides that any amount of loss ascertained
under subsection 44(4) or (5) of Act 53 prior to the year of assessment 2006


-----

38 _Bill_

shall not be available for a deduction in that year or subsequent years of
assessment if the shareholders of the company on the last day of the basis period
for year of assessment 2005 were not substantially the same with the shareholders
of the company in the year the said loss is available as a deduction under section
43 of Act 53. The loss which is not available for deduction in a year of
assessment will be disregarded for subsequent years of assessment.

_Clause 10_ also seeks to empower the Minister to exempt, under special

circumstances, any company from the restriction imposed under the special
provision relating to section 44 of Act 53.

These amendments will have effect for the year of assessment 2006 and

subsequent years of assessment.

6. _Clause 11 seeks to introduce new section 44A into Act 53. The new provision_

enables a company to surrender fifty per cent of its adjusted loss to its related
company subject to the conditions imposed under that section. However, both
the surrendering company and the claimant company must make an election to
surrender and claim the loss in its return furnished to the Director General of
Inland Revenue. The said loss which is surrendered will be available as a
