EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution) Act 1994
("Act 515") to provide for the implementation of the International Convention
on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992 ("Civil Liability Convention
1992") and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International
Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1992 ("Fund Convention
1992"). At present Act 515 implements the International Convention on Civil
Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 ("Civil Liability Convention 1969")
and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund
for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971 ("Fund Convention 1971").

2. The significance of the Civil Liability Convention 1992 and the Fund
Convention 1992 for Malaysia are as follows:

_(a)_ Greater geographical coverage

The geographical coverage offered by the Civil Liability Convention
1992 is greater compared to that covered by the Civil Liability Convention
1969. The new area extends to a distance of 200 nautical miles, which
will cover the whole of Malaysia's exclusive economic zone. Under
the Civil Liability Convention 1969, the maximum seaward area of
coverage ends at the limit of the territorial sea, a distance of 12
nautical miles.

The extension of the geographical coverage is provided in the

amendment to subsection 2(3) of Act 515 as proposed in clause 2(c)
of this Bill.

_(b)_ Unladen tankers

The Civil Liability Convention 1969 only covers ships actually carrying
oil in bulk as cargo. This means that oil spills from unladen tankers
would not be covered. The Civil Liability Convention 1992 extends
the coverage to oil spills from unladen tankers. This is particularly
useful for Malaysia as the Straits of Malacca is much favoured by
empty tankers returning to the Gulf from the Far East.


-----

# Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution) (Amendment) 13

This change in coverage is reflected in the amendment to the definition

of "ship" as proposed in clause 2(a)(ii) of this Bill.

_(c)_ Compensation for threat of oil pollution even when there is no actual

oil spill

The cost of pure threat removal is recoverable under the Civil Liability
Convention 1992 even when there is no actual oil spill. Under the
Civil Liability Convention 1969, there must be an actual oil spill
before any claim for preventive measures is admissible.

This is provided in the amendment to the definition of "incident"

in clause 2(a)(i) and the amendments to subsection 2(2) and section
3 of Act 515 as proposed in clauses 2(b) and 3 respectively. It is also
reflected in the amendment to the definition of "pollution damage"
as proposed in clause 2(a)(Hi) of this Bill.

_(d)_ Increased limits of liability

The maximum liability of a ship owner under the Civil Liability
Convention 1992 is significantly increased. This new liability is 4,510,000
special drawing rights for ships not exceeding 5,000 units of tonnage
and, for ships above 5,000 units of tonnage, 631 special drawing
rights for each additional unit of tonnage. With this high increase in
the limit of the ship owner's liability, there would be less call for
intervention under the Fund Convention 1992 because many cases
could be settled under the Civil Liability Convention 1992 (first tier).
Even if the Fund established under the Fund Convention 1992 (second
tier) is still required to provide compensation, the amount required
from this second tier recourse would be less than that under the Fund
Convention 1971, because a larger proportion of it is already settled
at the first tier. As a result, the burden of contribution required from
Malaysian oil receivers under the Fund Convention 1992 would be
reduced. However this increase in liability would not result in any
extra cost to the ship owner because the insurance coverage provided
by the Protection and Indemnity Association for oil pollution damage
is more than sufficient.

This increase is provided for in the amendments to sections 5, 6,

20 and 21 of Act 515 as proposed in clauses 4,5,11 and 12 respectively.

_(e)_ Increased second tier limit

The maximum limit of compensation under the Fund Convention
1992 is 203 million special drawing rights, that is more than triple
the previous limit of 60 million special drawing rights under the Fund
Convention 1971. This higher limit of compensation is essential to
Malaysia particularly in a major oil spill incident where damages can
easily exceed the limit under the Fund Convention 1971.

This is provided for in the amendments to section 19 of Act 515

and the First Schedule to Act 515 as proposed in _clauses 10_ and _16_
respectively.

3.  Clause 15 seeks to introduce a new section 30 into Act 515 to empower
the Minister to amend, add to or vary the Schedules to Act 515 by order
published in the Gazette.


-----

14 _Bill_

4. _Clause 16 seeks to introduce Part I of the First Schedule into Act 515 to_
provide for the limits of the ship owners liability under the Civil Liability
Convention 1992.

5. _Clause 17 seeks to amend the Second Schedule to Act 515 to provide for_
the names of the countries that are parties to the Civil Liability Convention
1992 and the Fund Convention 1992. The existing Second Schedule contains
the names of countries that are parties to the Civil Liability Convention 1969
and the Fund Convention 1971.

6. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
