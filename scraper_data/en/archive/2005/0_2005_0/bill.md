6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend the Fifth Schedule to Act 17 to strengthen the_

enforcement provisions.

The proposed amendment to subparagraph 2(1) empowers a Magistrate to

grant a search warrant to an officer of Bank Negara Malaysia appointed under
subsection 3(2) of Act 17. At present such search warrant can only be granted
to a police officer.

The proposed amendment to subparagraph 3(1) increases the period for

retention of any article seized under Act 17 from three months to twelve

introduction of a new subparagraph (2A) into that paragraph. The new subparagraph
provides for separate penalties for offences committed under subsection 4(1)
or (2) of Act 17. It also allows the court to make an order for the forfeiture
of any currency, gold or property which is involved in the commission of the
offence.

The proposed amendment to subparagraph 8(1) increases the amount of

compound for offences punishable under Part II or by virtue of Part III of the
Fifth Schedule to Act 17 from RMl,000 to an amount not exceeding 50% of
the maximum fine for the offence committed.

The proposed amendment to paragraph 10 is to substitute for the words

"Attorney General or the Controller" the words "Public Prosecutor" to bring
the paragraph in line with the provisions of Article 145 of the Federal Constitution.

7. Other amendments not specifically referred to in this Statement are minor

or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
