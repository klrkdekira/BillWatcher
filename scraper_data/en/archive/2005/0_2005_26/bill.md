... (the possible offence under this Act). Do you wish to say
anything? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your
defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it

offence under this Act, evidence is given that the accused, on
being informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention
any such fact, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at

made out a prima facie case against the accused and in determining
whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw
such inference from the failure as appear proper; and the failure
may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable
of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given against the
accused in relation to which the failure is material.

(7) Nothing in subsection (6) shall, in any criminal proceedings—

_(a)_ prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or

other reaction of the accused in the face of anything said in
his presence relating to the conduct in respect of which he is
charged, in so far as evidence thereof would be admissible
apart from that subsection; or


-----

64 _Bill_

the offence, even though no person has been convicted of such
offence.

book, document or other thing seized under this Act, such object,
