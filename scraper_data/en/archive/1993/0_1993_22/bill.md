EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Fire Services Act 1988.

_2. Clause 1 gives the short title of the Bill._

3. Clause 2 seeks to make a general amendment by inserting the
word "First" or "FIRST" before the word "Schedule" or
"SCHEDULE" wherever it appears in the Act. This amendment is
necessitated by the introduction of a new Second Schedule in the
Bill.

4. Clause 3 seeks to introduce a new subsection (6) to provide
that the ranks of Fire Officers and Auxiliary Fire Officers are as
set out in the new Second Schedule.

5. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 7 to include the power of the
Director-General under section 35A(1) as one of the powers which
may, subject to the control and direction of the Director-General,
be exercised by a State Director. Under subclause 4(b) the Director-
General may, in writing, delegate the exercise of any of his powers
or the performance of any of his duties to any Fire Officer.
Previously such delegation had to be done by notification in the

_Gazette._

_6. Clause 5 seeks to introduce two new provisions, namely sections_
35A and 35e. The proposed new section 35A seeks to empower the
Director-General to direct the owner or occupier of any premises

to cease any activity if he is satisfied that the continuation of such
activity would constitute an immediate danger of fire prejudicial to
the safety of life or property. The Director-General should also be
satisfied that any delay in obtaining a prohibitory order would
substantially increase the risk to such life or property before making
an order under section 35A(1). The new section 35b provides for
an appeal to be made to the High Court against an order of the
Director-General made under section 35A(1). However such appeal
would not automatically operate as a stay of execution, though the
court may, on application, grant a stay on such terms as it may think
fit.

6 BILL

7. Clause 6 seeks to introduce a new section 48B to prevent
unscrupulous persons from carrying on activities allegedly to raise
monies for the Welfare Fund without the knowledge or approval
of the Director-General. The new section 48B prohibits persons from
carrying on such activities without the prior written consent of the
Fire Services Department Welfare Fund Committee. Contravention
of this provision would constitute an offence.

8. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 62 to empower the Minister
to make regulations to regulate the establishment of voluntary fire-
brigades.

9. An order to cease activity made by the Director-General shall
be in Form G and clause 8 sets out this form.

10. Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new Second Schedule which sets

out the ranks of Fire Officers as well as Auxiliary Fire Officers.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1724.]
