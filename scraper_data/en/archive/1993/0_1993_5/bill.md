_Act 361_

**EXPLANATORY STATEMENT**

This Bill seeks to make better provisions for overcoming unfair
trade practices relating to the dumping and subsidization of
merchandise imported into Malaysia. Upon becoming law, it will
replace the existing Customs (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1959.


-----

**38** **BILL**

The provisions in this Bill authorise the imposition and collection
of anti-dumping and countervailing duties to offset such activities
of dumping and subsidies, which have caused or are threatening to
cause injury to the domestic industry in Malaysia.

2. Part I of this Bill deals with preliminary matters. Clause 1

provides for the short title and provisions on the commencement
of the proposed Act and clause 2 defines certain words and
expressions used in this Bill.

3. Parts II and III respectively deals with the actions to be taken

in respect of the dumping and subsidization of merchandise imported
into Malaysia. Such actions include the initiation of investigation
into the dumping or subsidization practice and injury to the domestic
industry in Malaysia upon a complaint filed by a domestic producer,
the preliminary and final determinations on such investigations, the
circumstances where suspension of investigation are permitted, the
administrative reviews contemplated and the matters open to appeals
and which may be permitted to be taken to the Tribunal.

4. Administrative matters are dealt with in Part IV. This Part

provides, inter alia, for the administrative set up where complaints
in the form of petition can be directed, the relevant authorities that
would be conducting the investigations, making the preliminary and
final determinations and collecting the duties, the establishment of
the Tribunal and the protection of officers in the performance of
their duties. In addition, clause 33 provides that the Minister of
Finance may make special provisions in relation to specified areas,
such as Free Zones, which due to the purpose for which they are
set up, may require to be dealt with by way of special provisions
in the form of regulations. Clause 34 provides for the proposed Act
to be construed as one with the Customs Act 1967. With this, an
officer of customs shall have all the powers conferred by the
Customs Act 1967 in relation to the collection and enforcement of
customs duties for the purpose of the collection of the countervailing
and dumping duties imposed under this Bill.

5. Part V deals with general provisions, and enunciates the

principles which the Government will adopt in dealing, inter alia,
with merchandise imported into Malaysia from more than one
country which are subject to both an anti-dumping and subsidy
investigation (clause 35), false statements (clause 36), protection
of confidential information (clause 39) and the use of facts available
if faced with an uncooperative interested party (clause 41}, as well
as other practices discovered in the course of an investigation (clause
_42). Under clause 37, anti-circumvention measures are also_
contemplated to be regulated by way of regulations made by the
Minister. Another important provision is the principle that the
minimum treatment accorded in the Bill will not extend to interested


-----

**COUNTERVAILING AND ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES** **39**

parties if the country in which they operate has no applicable
international obligations with Malaysia. This is provided in clause

_43. Clause 50 empowers the Minister to make regulations for the_
purposes of the proposed Act. Clause 51 deals with the repeal of
the Customs (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1959.

**_FINANCIAL_** **_IMPLICATIONS_**

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure
the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.
