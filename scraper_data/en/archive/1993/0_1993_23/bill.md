Under the existing provision, this power is vested in the police and
road transport officers only.

18. _Clause 21 seeks to amend subsection 58(2) to enable a police_

person in charge of a motor vehicle on a road to produce his driving

as a public body for the purposes of the Act.

to the licensing of commercial vehicles are repealed by that Act
and that subsidiary legislations in respect of the licensing of
commercial vehicles are saved under that Act.

specifically referred to are consequential or minor in nature.
