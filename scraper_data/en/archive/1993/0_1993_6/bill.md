**EXPLANATORY STATEMENT**

This Bill seeks to amend the Evidence Act 1950 ("the Act") by
introducing certain new provisions and amending certain existing

provisions.

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 3 of the Act which contains_

definitions of words and expressions used in the Act.

The principal amendment is made under paragraph (b) of this

_clause whereby the definition of "document" is substituted by a new_
definition which embraces all forms of expression or description
upon any substance, material, thing or article, and expressly includes
within the scope of the meaning of "document" any matter embodied
in a disc, tape, film, sound track or other device whatsoever by
means of forms of expression which are set out under paragraphs
_(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the definition._

The illustrations to the definition have been amended so as to

include within the meaning of "document" certain forms of
documents which are within the scope of the new definition, such
as tape recordings of telephonic communications, photographic or
other visual recordings, and matters recorded, stored, processed,
retrieved or produced by a computer.

Under paragraph (a) of clause 2 a definition of "computer" is

introduced as new provisions relating to evidence produced by
computers are introduced into the Act by subsequent clauses of this
Bill.

Paragraph (c) of clause 2 of the Bill inserts the definition of

"film" and "negative", being words which are used in the new
definition of "document" mentioned above. The word "microfilm"
is also defined as it is used in the definition of "film".


-----

**EVIDENCE (AMENDMENT)** **9**

3. Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 3lA into
the Act which provides that in a criminal proceeding a written or
verbal statement made by a person charged with an offence which
is admissible in evidence under or by virtue of any written law,
would be so admissible only if evidence of the statement is given
by the officer to whom it was made or by the person who is charged
with the offence.

However, subsection (2) seeks to provide that the above

restriction would not affect the provisions of sections 90A, 90B and
90c which relate to documents produced by computers, or the
provisions of section 145 which relates to cross-examination as to
previous statements in writing, or the provisions of section 155
which relates to impeachment of the credit of a witness.

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 32 of the Act by adding two
new paragraphs (i) and {j}. Paragraph (i) enables a statement made
in the course of, or for the purpose of, an investigation or inquiry
into an offence under or by virtue of a written law to itself constitute
a relevant fact where it is made by a person who is dead, or cannot
be found, or who is not available for the reasons specified in section
32.

Similarly, the new paragraph (j) enables a statement made by a

public officer in the discharge of his duties to itself constitute a
relevant fact where the public officer is dead, or cannot be found,
or is not available for reasons specified in section 32. By a new
subsection (2) which is sought to be added to section 32, the
provisions of the new paragraphs (i) and (j) mentioned above would
only apply in relation to a criminal proceeding.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend the existing subsection (3) of section_

60 of the Act which excludes the production of documents for the
examination of the court. The amendment will enable documents
to be included as material which can be produced before the court
and examined by the court.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 62 of the Act by inserting a
new explanation to the meaning of primary document whereby a
document produced by a computer is rendered primary evidence.

7. _Clause 7 seeks to amend paragraph (e) of section 63 of the Act_

so as to bring within the scope of secondary evidence oral accounts
of the contents of documents given by a person who has heard the
document, or perceived it by whatever means.

_8._ _Clause 8 introduces a new section 78A into the Act whereby_

sections 90A, 90B and 90C which relate to documents produced by
computers are rendered applicable to a public document
notwithstanding the provisions of sections 77 and 78 which relate
to proof of public documents.


-----

**10** **BILL**

9. Clause 9 introduces new sections 90A, 90B and 90c into Chapter
V of the Act which contain provisions on documentary evidence.

The new section 90A provides clearly that a document produced

by a computer, or a statement contained in such document, would
be admissible in any suit or proceeding as evidence of any fact
stated therein.The admissibility of the computer document is made
subject to the condition that the document was produced in the
course of the ordinary use of the computer for that purpose.

Subsection (2) of section 90A provides that matters stated above

relating to the condition of admissibility may be proved by a

certificate given by a person responsible for the management of the
operation of the computer or for the conduct of the activities it was
used for.

Subsection (3) relates to the contents and admissibility of a

certificate given under subsection (2).

Subsection (4) provides for a presumption that the computer in

respect of which a certificate is given under subsection (2) was in
good working order and was operating properly in all respects
throughout the material part of the period during which the document
was produced by the computer.

Subsection (5) provides for a document produced by a computer

to be deemed to be so produced in cases in which it was produced
by means of an appropriate equipment, whether or not there was

any direct or indirect human intervention.

Subsection (6) enables documents produced by a computer after

the commencement of a criminal or civil proceeding, or of any

investigation or inquiry in relation thereto, to be admissible in
evidence and to be deemed to have been produced by the computer

in the course of its ordinary use.

Subsection (7) seeks to provide that a document produced by a

computer or a statement contained in such document shall not be

admissible in evidence in a criminal proceeding where it is given
by or on behalf of a person charged with an offence if such person

was responsible for the management of the operation of that
computer or for the conduct of the activities for which the computer

was used, or was in any manner or to any extent involved directly
or indirectly in the production of the document by the computer.

Section 90B allows the court to draw inferences from

circumstances relating to evidence admissible under section 90A,

including the manner and purpose of its creation and its contents,
the purpose of its production in evidence, and the physical
effectiveness of the computer, equipment and other devices used

in creating the document, when evaluating the probative value of

such evidence. To assist the courts in so doing, this section also


-----

**EVIDENCE (AMENDMENT)** **11**

provides for the factors which the court may have regard to in
estimating the weight to be attached to the computer document or
the statement contained in it, which is rendered admissible under
section 90A. These factors include circumstances in which inferences
can be drawn as to the accuracy, contemporaneous supply of the
information recorded, and incentive to conceal or misrepresent any
fact by any person concerned with the production of such evidence.

Section 90c makes it clear that sections 90A and 90B are to have

effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Act or in the
Bankers' Books (Evidence) Act 1949 or in any other written law
relating to certification, production or extraction of documents, or
in rule of law or practice relating to production, admission, or proof,
of evidence in any criminal or civil proceeding which are
inconsistent with the new provisions.

**_FINANCIAL_** **_IMPLICATIONS_**

This Bid wilt not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U-) 1629.]
