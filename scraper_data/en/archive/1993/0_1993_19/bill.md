EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Trade Marks Act 1976 (hereinafter
referred to as "the Act").

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act to make it clear that_

the Act applies also to trade marks registered under the respective
repealed Ordinances. The continued application of the repealed
Ordinances to applications made before the commencement of the Act
is already provided for in subsection 2(3) of the Act.

3. Clause 3 seeks to introduce certain new definitions to subsection
3( 1) of the Act. Clause 3(a)(t) and 3(a)(v) respectively provide for the
definition of "Convention country" and "prescribed foreign country"
to facilitate the reading of sections 70 and 70A. Clause 3(a)(ii) seeks
to make it clear that the context in which the words "in the course of
trade" are used in the Act extends also to the provision of services.
_Clause 3(a)(vi) seeks to provide for the definition of "specification"_
to facilitate the reading of section 43. Clause 3(a)(vii) seeks to enlarge


-----

TRADE MARKS (AMENDMENT) 33

the definition of "trade marks" to include not only a mark in relation
to goods but also to services. Clause 3(b) seeks to amend subsection
_3(2) of the Act by adding a new paragraph (c) to aid the interpretation_
of use of a trade mark in relation to services.

4. Clause 4(a) seeks to amend section 4 of the Act to provide for the
appointment of the Registrar of Trade Marks by the Minister. By the
amendment in clause 4(b) only the Registrar determines the powers
and functions of Assistant Registrars under the Act.

5. Clause 5 seeks to provide for the establishment of trade marks
offices.

6. _Clause 8(a)(ii) seeks to amend paragraph l 0 ( l ) ( e ) of the Act to_

make it clear that the distinctive mark referred to therein is distinct
from and does not include the particulars mentioned in paragraph

10(l)(a) to (d) for the purpose of considering a distinctive mark

registrable in Part A of the Register. Clause 8(b) seeks to introduce
new subsections 10(2A) and 10(2B) to the Act. The new subsection

10(2A) provides the test for distinctiveness in relation to goods or

services registered or proposed to be registered in Part A of the
Register and the new subsection 10(2B) further amplifies the test.
These new subsections essentially incorporate the provisions of the
existing subsections 12(1) and 12(2) of the Act. Since the existing
subsections 12(1) and 12(2) are intended to relate to Part A
registrations only, it is appropriate that they be incorporated in section

10 which relates to trade marks registrable in Part A.

7. Clause 9(a) seeks to change the test for registration of trade marks
in Part B of the Register from "it must be distinctive or capable of
becoming distinctive" to "capable of distinguishing the goods or
services" to make it consistent with section 73 of the Act and regulation

17 of the Trade Marks Regulations 1983. What is "capable of

distinguishing" is further amplified in the new subsection ll(lA)
_(clause 9(b))._

8. Clause 10 seeks to substitute section 12. The new section 12
essentially incorporates the existing subsections 12(3), 12(4) and

12(5) of the Act and applies to both Part A and Part B registrations.

9. _Clauses ll(a) and (b) seek to amend section 14 so that a mark or_

part of a mark shall not be registered if it has any one of the qualities
mentioned in that section. Clause ll(c) seeks to introduce a new
paragraph 14(c) which empowers the Registrar to reject an application
for registration of a mark or part of a mark on grounds of national
interest or security.

10. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 16 to make it consistent with_

regulation 15 of the Trade Marks Regulations 1983.


-----

34 BILL

11. Clause 14 seeks to introduce a new section 19 which provides

for the prohibition of registration of identical or similar trade marks
belonging to different proprietors which are likely to deceive or cause
confusion in respect of the same services or description of services or
in respect of goods that are closely related to those services. It also
seeks to stipulate the test for refusal of an application for registration
of identical or so nearly resembling trade marks in respect of the same

goods or description of goods or in respect of services closely related
to those goods. It also deals with the situation where applications are
in respect of the same services or description of services or at least one
of the applications is in respect of services and the other or others is
or are in respect of goods closely related to those services. In such
cases, the Registrar may refuse to proceed with the registration until
the rights of the applicants have been determined by the Court or have
been settled by agreement in a manner approved by the Registrar or the
Court.

12. _Clause 75 seeks to make it clear that subsections 20(1) and_

20(lA) are exceptions to subsections 19(1) and 19(2). It spells out the
circumstances in which identical or similar marks may be registered
by more than one proprietor in respect of the same goods or services
or description of goods or services or in respect of goods and services
closely related to those goods or services.

13. _Clause 17 seeks to amend section 22 to provide for associated_

marks in relation to services.

14. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 24 to clarify that a series of_

trade marks can only arise within a single class.

15. _Clause I9(b) seeks to amend subsection 25(12) to provide for_

the reissuance of new acceptance after withdrawal of acceptance in
respect of a trade mark which should have been made subject to
additional or different conditions or limitations.

16. The amendments in clause 22 seek to do away with the "post

office" function of the Registrar. With the amendments, the applicant
for registration of a trade mark and the opponent communicate
directly with each other instead of through the Registrar as is the
practice now, but the opponent and applicant are obliged to keep the
Registrar informed of the notices of opposition and counter-
statements. The new subsection 28(3) (clause 22(b)) requires the
applicant to send a counter-statement on receipt of notice of opposition
or else his application will be deemed abandoned. Further, if the
applicant submits such a counter-statement, both the applicant and the
opponent must file evidence and exhibits to support the counter-
statement or opposition (clause 22(c)) and if either fails to do so, the

application or opposition will be treated as abandoned. The opponent,

however, is given the opportunity to give evidence in reply. Clause
_22(d) introduces a new subsection 28(4) which states that the Registrar_
shall only make his decision after considering the written submissions
of the applicant and opponent.

TRADE MARKS (AMENDMENT) 35

17. _Clause 23 seeks to amend section 29 to maintain consistency_

with the marginal note as well as regulation 54 of the Trade Marks
Regulations 1983.

18. _Clause 24(c) seeks to introduce a new paragraph 3l(2)(c) to_

reflect that the registration of a trade mark may be delayed by an action
on the part of the Central Trade Marks office or any trade marks office.

19. _Clause 26(c)(iit) seeks to introduce a new paragraph 33(2)fc) to_

provide for the treatment of trade marks in relation to services where
words which describe the services become well known. These are the
counterpart provisions to paragraphs 33(2)(a) and (b) of the Act which
presently only provide for goods.

20. _Clause 27 seeks to amend subsection 35(2) by deleting the_

words "whether for the same goods or different goods" to make the
section applicable to both goods and services.

21. _Clause 29(a)(iv) seeks to introduce a new paragraph 38(l)(c)_

which is the corollary of paragraph 38(1 )(b) to provide for
circumstances in which the provision of services amounts to
infringement.

22. _Clause 30 seeks to provide that use of a trade mark by express_

or implied consent does not constitute an infringement.

23. Clause 31(b) seeks to amend subsection 41(2) to make it clear
that fees are prescribed both for renewal and restoration of registration
of a trade mark. Clause 3l(c) seeks to prohibit renewal where
application for renewal is made after one year has lapsed from the date
of expiration of last registration.

24. _Clause 32 seeks to amend section 42 to provide that the period_

of one year that a trade mark is deemed to be on the Register after
removal is counted from the date of expiration of last registration.

25. _Clause 33 seeks to amend subsection 43(2) to emphasise that a_

registered user who makes an application to correct an error or enter
any change in the name, address or description of a registered user
does so only in relation to himself and not in relation to other
registered users.

26. Clause 34 seeks to make various amendments to section 46 so
that an application by an aggrieved person under that section for an
order to remove a trade mark from the Register is made to the Court
only, so as to reduce the burden of the Registrar. Clause 34(b) seeks
to amend subsection 46(2) to provide for the circumstances where the
registration of a trade mark need not be struck off for non-use of the
trade mark for both goods and services.


-----

36 BILL

27. _Clause 36 seeks to introduce a new section 48 to provide a_

simple recordal system in respect of registered users.

28. _Clause 37 seeks to simplify the provisions of section 49 relating_

to the cancellation of the registration of a registered user.

29- _Clause 38 seeks to delete section 50._

30- _Clause 39 seeks to delete section 53 of the Act which provides_

for hearing by the Registrar. There is no necessity for a hearing since
recordal of registered users are by way of notification to the Registrar
and no control over the contractual relationship between the proprietor
and the registered user is exercised by the Registry under the
amendment in clause 36.

31. _Clause 40 seeks to abolish appeals to the Court consequent upon_

the deletion of section 53 in clause 39.

32. _Clause 4l(b) seeks to provide for the assignment and_

transmission of unregistered trade marks. Clause 4I(c) seeks to
prohibit the assignment and transmission of trade marks if as a result
of the assignment or transmission more than one proprietor will have
exclusive rights to the use of identical trade marks or nearly resembling
trade marks. Clause 41 (d) seeks to amend subsection 55(5) to require
