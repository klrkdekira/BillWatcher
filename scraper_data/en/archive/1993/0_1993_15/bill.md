EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The proposed Promotion of Investments (Amendment) Act 1993
(hereinafter referred to as "the Act") seeks to amend the Promotion
of Investments Act 1986 by introducing certain new provisions and
amending certain existing provisions.

2. Clause 1 seeks to provide for preliminary matters and states the
different dates for the coming into force of the various sections of
the Act.

20 BILL

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend subsection 2(1). The definition of the_

word "Minister" is amended so that it refers to the "Minister of
International Trade and Industry" following the change in the
Ministry's name. The definitions of "promoted activity" and
"promoted product" have been amended respectively to include the
activity or product referred to in the new section 4A. The definition
of "registered government programme" is deleted in view of the
abolition of the incentive under section 33A.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 4 by deleting paragraph (3)(c)_

as it is no longer required in view of the provisions of the new
section 4A.

5. Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new section 4A whereby the
Minister with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance may deem
any activity or product which is of national and strategic importance
to Malaysia to be a promoted activity or promoted product.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 5 by introducing a new_

subsection (1A). This new subsection relates to the application for
pioneer status by any company or person who is proposing to
register a company and is desirous of establishing or participating
in an activity or of participating in producing a product which is of
national and strategic importance to Malaysia.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 6 to make some amendments_

which are consequential to the amendments made to section 5. At
the same time it seeks to introduce a new subsection 6(lAB) to
provide for the granting of pioneer status to a company or person
who is establishing or participating in an activity or is participating
in producing a product which qualifies to be a promoted activity or
promoted product, as the case may be, under section 4A.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend subsection 14A(1) to subject the same_

subsection to the proposed new section 14B. It also seeks to extend
the application of the section to cover not only the manufacturing
activity but also an activity relating to the treatment of water.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to introduce the new sections 14B and 14c._

Section 14B restricts the application of section 14A to only a
company whose application for pioneer status has been received
before 1st November 1991. This means that extension of the tax
relief period will not be granted to any company whose application
for pioneer status is received on or after 1st November 1991.
Notwithstanding that, section 14c, however, allows extension of the
tax relief period to a company which has been granted pioneer status
under subsection 6(lAB).

10. _Clause 9 seeks to make a consequential amendment to_

paragraph (1)(b) of section 21. It also seeks to introduce a new

subsection 21(5) to provide that section 21, in relation to the


-----

**PROMOTION OF INVESTMENTS (AMENDMENT)** 21

computation of income during the tax relief period, shall apply to
a company which has been granted pioneer status prior to 1st
November 1991 pursuant to an application received prior to 1st
November 1991. The same section 21 shall also apply to a company
which has been granted pioneer status on or after 1st November

1991 but whose application for pioneer status was received prior to
1st November 1991.

11. Clause 10 seeks to introduce the new sections 21B and 21c.

Under the new section 21 B a company which applies for and is
granted pioneer status on or after 1st November 1991 will no longer
be exempt from tax on all its profits. The company will now have
to pay tax on thirty per cent of its statutory income. The new section
21c, on the other hand, provides for the computation of income
during the tax relief period for a company which has been granted
pioneer status under subsection 6(1 AB). Such company will enjoy a
hundred per cent tax exemption on all its income.

12. Clause 11 seeks to make consequential amendments to section

22.

13. Clause 12 seeks to make consequential amendments to section

25.

14. Clause 13 seeks to introduce a new section 26A to allow any

company intending to establish or participate in an activity or to
participate in producing a product which is of national and strategic
importance to Malaysia to apply for investment tax allowance.

15. Clause 14 seeks to amend paragraph (ii) of the proviso to

subsection 27(1) to restrict the backdating of investment tax
allowance to only three years from the date the application under
subsection 26(1) is received by the Minister and not to five years
as is currently allowed.

16. Clause 15 seeks to introduce a new section 27A which allows

the Minister to grant approval in respect of an application for
investment tax allowance made under the new subsection 26A(1).

17. Clause 10 seeks to make consequential amendments to section

28.

18. Clause 17 seeks to amend section 29 to clarify that the

investment tax allowance granted under the section relates to the
promoted activity or promoted product concerned. It also seeks to
restrict the application of the section to a company which has been
granted approval under section 27 prior to 1st November 1991 and
a company whose application under section 26 was received prior
to 1st November 1991 but which was granted approval under section
27 on or after 1st November 1991.


-----

22 BILL

19. Clause 18 seeks to introduce the new sections 29A and 29B.
Under section 29A, a company which applies for and is granted
investment tax allowance on or after 1st November 1991 will be
given an allowance of sixty per cent on the capital expenditure
incurred. (Under the existing subsection 29(1) the current maximum
allowance is one hundred per cent of the capital expenditure.) The

exempt shall not exceed seventy per cent of the statutory income for

29A(5)

the year of assessment. Any unutilised allowance can be carried
forward to subsequent years. Section 29B, on the other hand,
provides that a company which has been granted approval under
section 21 A, will be given an investment tax allowance of one
hundred per cent of the capital expenditure incurred.

20. _Clause 19 seeks to amend section 32 by introducing a new_

paragraph (5)(b) to provide that the income of a company derived
from the operation of a factory in a promoted industrial area where

_(5)(b)_

industrial

such factory has commenced operations on or after the 1st January

1992 will not be given any abatement.

will


21. _Clause 20 seeks to amend section 33 by inserting a new_

subsection (5) to provide that the section, which provides for
abatement of adjusted income for small scale companies, shall not

(5)

apply to a small scale company which commences a business of the
manufacture of products in Malaysia on or after 1st January 1992.

22. _Clause 21 seeks to delete section 33A as the incentive of_
abatement of adjusted income for purchasers from small scale
companies will no longer be given.

23. _Clause 22 seeks to amend section 34 by restricting the_
application of the section to not only a company which has complied
with the Government policy on capital participation or employment
in industry but also to a company which has been granted an
abatement of adjusted income under subsection (1) prior to 1st
January 1992. This means that only companies falling within the

(1)

scope of paragraphs 34(4)(a) and (b) will be given the incentive of
the abatement of adjusted income in respect of their business.

_34(4)(a)_


24. Clause 23 seeks to make a consequential amendment to section
35.

25. _Clause 24 seeks to amend the heading to Chapter 4 by_
substituting for the word "Adjusted" the word "Statutory".

26. _Clause 25 seeks to amend subsection 36(1) and the marginal_
note to the section by substituting for the word "adjusted" the word
"statutory". This means that from the year of assessment 1993, the
abatement for export performance will be applied to the statutory
income of the company instead of the adjusted income. The


-----

PROMOTION OF INVESTMENTS (AMENDMENT) 23

amendment to subsection 36(2) provides for the computation of
statutory income to be abated. This is ascertained by applying to the
statutory income a rate which is equivalent to fifty per cent of export
sales as bears to total sales. However, where the basis period of a
company for the year of assessment 1993 includes a period prior to

1st January 1992, then the amount to be abated shall be the total of

the amounts stipulated in paragraphs 36(2)(a) and (h). that is, the
total of an amount ascertained by applying to the adjusted income
a rate which is equivalent to fifty per cent of export sales in the
period prior to 1st January 1992 as bears to the total sales for the
whole of the basis period and an amount ascertained by applying to
the statutory income a rate which is equivalent to fifty per cent of
export sales in the period after 31st December 1991 as bears to the
total sales for the whole of the basis period. The amendment to
paragraph 36(4)(a) and subsection 36(5) seek to abolish the five per
cent abatement given for the use of indigenous materials.

27. Clause 26 seeks to make a consequential amendment to section
36A.

28. _Clause 27 seeks to make consequential amendments to section_

37.

29. Clause 28 seeks to make consequential amendments to section
39. It also seeks to introduce a new paragraph (c) to the proviso to
subsection (1). This is to provide that subsection 39(1) shall not
apply to the period prescribed under paragraph 29B(2)(h) in respect
of an activity or of producing a product for which the company has
been granted approval under section 27A.

30. Clause 29 seeks to make consequential amendments to section
43A.

31. Clause 30 seeks to make consequential amendments to section
50B.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1761.)
