EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1967 ("the
Act").

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2A of the Act by adding a new_
subsection (4). The new subsection (4) provides that officers
appointed under subsection 2A(2) shall perform all the duties
imposed and may exercise all the powers conferred upon the
Director General subject to any limitation as may be prescribed by
regulations.

3. Clause 3 seeks to introduce a new proviso to subsection 8(1).
The new proviso provides that the provisions of section 20 shall
apply in all dismissal cases. This is in order to achieve uniformity
in dealing with dismissal cases irrespective of the reason for the
dismissal.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to substitute section 9. The new section 9_
essentially incorporates the existing subsections 9(2), 9(3) and 9(4)
of the Act with slight modifications. The new paragraph 9(2)(c)
which is the counterpart provision of the existing paragraph 9(3)(c)
modifies the latter by providing that the Director General may, at
the request of a trade union of workmen making a claim for
recognition, ascertain not only the percentage of the workmen or
class of workmen in respect of whom recognition is sought to be
accorded who are members of the trade union, but also the
percentage of such workmen or class of workmen who wish to be
represented by such trade union. The word "percentage" is
introduced since the result of a membership check by way of a
membership verification exercise or secret ballot is given in
percentage.

5. Clause 5 seeks to introduce new sections 9A. 9B, 9c and 9D to
set out clearly, concisely and with certainty the powers, duties and
functions of the Director General at each stage of a claim for
recognition. The new sections are essentially an incorporation of
existing provisions which are modified, renumbered and rearranged
together with some new provisions.


-----

INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS (AMENDMENT)

The new section 9A replaces the existing subsections 9(4A) and
(4B) and sets out clearly the steps to be taken by the Director
General in resolving a claim for recognition. By paragraph 9A(2)(a)
the Director General is now empowered to specify a time frame for
the submission of relevant information required from either the
trade union of workmen or the employer.

The new section 9B is a deeming provision intended to expedite
the process of according recognition and to give finality to a claim
for recognition. Where the membership verification exercise reveals
that a majority of the workmen or class of workmen in respect of
whom recognition is sought to be accorded are members of the
trade union making the claim, or the result of a secret ballot shows
that the majority of such workmen or class of workmen wish to
be represented by the trade union, the employer is deemed to have
accorded recognition. The matter is deemed to have been resolved
with the trade union not being accorded recognition when the result
shows otherwise.

The new section 9c empowers the Director General, in the event
of a failure to supply the required information under paragraph
_9A(2)(a), to require the parties to attend a conference and there to_
furnish the information. The section deems the trade union to have
abandoned its claim or the employer to have had no objection to
the claim for recognition in the event of non-compliance.

The new section 9D essentially incorporates the existing
subsection 9(1) and deals with the scope of representation of a
trade union of workmen and the determination of the employment
capacity of a workman in recognition matters.

6. Clause 6 seeks to make consequential amendments to
subsections 10(1) and (3) of the Act necessitated by the introduction
of the new sections 9, 9A, 9B, 9c and 9D. It also seeks to amend
subsection 10(2) by adding a new proviso (c) to make it lawful for
an employer to terminate the services of a workman on grounds of
retirement, expiry of a fixed term contract or the non-confirmation
of a probationer during the pendency of a claim for recognition.

7. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 11 to make the provision
clearer as a claim for recognition is now governed by the new
section 9.

8. Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section 11A to prohibit
another trade union of workmen from making a claim for
recognition or being accorded recognition in respect of the same
workmen or class of workmen during the pendency of an existing
claim.


-----

BILL

9. Clause 9 seeks to make consequential amendments to section
12 of the Act in line with the new section 9 and the deeming
provision in subsection 9c(2).

10. _Clause 10 seeks to delete section 15 which has outlived its_
usefulness.

11. Clause II seeks to amend subsection 20(1) by adding a new
proviso to make it clear that a representation for reinstatement shall
be made by the dismissed workman himself, irrespective of whether
he is a member of a trade union or not.

12. _Clause 12 seeks to amend subsection 27(1) by deleting the_
words "(in proceedings under section 20(3))" in paragraphs (c) and
_(d). With the deletion a workman may appear himself personally,_
or be represented by an officer or employee of the trade union of
which he is a member, or by an advocate if permitted by the
President or the Chairman, or by an official of an organization of
workmen registered in Malaysia in all proceedings before the
Industrial Court.

13. _Clause 13 seeks to amend subsection 33(5) to remove rigidity_
on the constitution of the Industrial Court and to enable any
division of the Court to deal with the interpretation and variation
of an award or collective agreement under section 33 of the Act.

14. _Clause 14 deals with savings provision._

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure
the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN. (U[2]) 1729.]
