**EXPLANATORY STATEMENT**

This Bill seeks to amend the Patents Act 1983, which is referred
to as the "Act" in this Statement.

2. Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 3 of the Act to
introduce several new definitions. The definitions of "filing date",
"owner of the patent", "prescribed", "priority date", "process" and
"product" are introduced to remove ambiguities.

3. Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend subsection 4(2) of the Act.
At the moment all members of the Patents Board, including those
representing bodies and organisations specifically mentioned in that
section, are appointed by the Minister. With the proposed
amendment those bodies and organisations will be able to appoint
their own representatives.

_Clause 3 also seeks to amend subsection 4(3) of the Act. At the_

moment all members of the Patents Board, except the representative
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the representative of the
Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment, hold office
for a maximum period of two years. They are, however, eligible
for reappointment. With the amendment, the tenure of office of
every member whose appointment is made by the body or
organisation he represents is no longer subject to the maximum
period of two years.

4. _Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to amend subsection 14(2) of the_

Act to redefine "prior art". The amendment makes anything relating


-----

PATENTS (AMENDMENT) 25

to an invention which is disclosed anywhere in the world prior to
the priority date of a patent application claiming that invention part
of the prior art and this will affect the patentability of the invention.
At the moment disclosures made orally, for example, would only
constitute "prior art" if they are made in Malaysia.

_Clause 6 also seeks to make it clear that if the use of any substance_

or composition in a method for the treatment of the human or animal
body or in diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal
body is not part of the prior art, then the fact that the substance
or composition itself is part of the prior art does not exclude the
patentability of such use.

5. Clause 7 of the Bill seeks to replace the existing definition of
"utility innovation" with a new definition which is wider. This will
enable more innovations to be protected under the Act, thus
encouraging the development of technology in the country.
Inventions have also been included in the proposed new definition
as some inventors may prefer to apply for a certificate for a utility
innovation rather than a patent.

6. Clause 9 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 17B which
allows the conversion of an application for a patent into an
application for a certificate for a utility innovation, and vice versa.

_Clause 9 also seeks to introduce a new section 17C which_

prohibits the grant of both a patent and a certificate for a utility
innovation for the same invention. This will ensure that an inventor
does not enjoy overwhelming monopoly in respect of his invention.

7. Clause 10 of the Bill seeks to amend section 18 of the Act by
introducing a new subsection (4) which identifies the person to
whom the right to a patent for an invention, made separately and
independently by two or more persons, belongs.

8. Clause 12 of the Bill seeks to amend section 25 of the Act to
ensure that withdrawals of applications are made in writing. The
amendment also seeks to prohibit the revocation of any withdrawal.

This prohibition will avoid complications in search procedures.

9. Clause 14 of the Bill seeks to amend section 27 of the Act to
ensure that any priority claim made is limited to applications filed
during the period of twelve months immediately preceding the filing
date of the application in which such claim is made.

10. Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 27A to

make it clear what the priority date of an application is.

11. Clauses 16, 17 and 18 of the Bill seek to amend sections 29

and 30 of the Act and also to introduce a new section 29A. The
proposed amendments seek to provide for a simpler preliminary


-----

26 BILL

examination and to allow an applicant to apply for a modified
substantive examination if a patent or other title of protection has
been granted in a prescribed country outside Malaysia in respect
of the invention for which a patent is applied. The proposed
amendments will expedite the process of examining applications for
patents.

12. Clause 19 of the Bill seeks to amend section 31 of the Act.

Under the proposed amendment, if two or more persons have
separately and independently made an invention and each of them
has applied for a patent and the applications have the same priority
date, then a patent may be granted on each of such applications.

13. Clause 20 of the Bill seeks to amend section 32 of the Act.

At the moment, section 32 specifies the particulars to be recorded
in the Register. With the proposed amendment, such details will be
prescribed by regulations made under the Act. Changes in such
details, should such changes become necessary, will therefore be
easier to make.

The proposed amendment also seeks to provide for the making

of regulations to prescribe the form in which and the medium on
which the Register is to be kept. This will enable the Register to
be kept on electronic medium or any other medium.

14. Clause 21 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 32A

into the Act to exclude notices of any trust from the Register in
view of the fact that such notices have no significance in the granting
of patents.

15. Clause 22 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 33A

into the Act to make the Register prima facie evidence of all matters
required or authorized by the Act to be entered therein and to make
copies or extracts from, inter alia, the Register admissible as
evidence in court without further proof or production of the original,
on condition that such copies or extracts are certified by the Registrar
in writing under his hand.

_Clause 22 of the Bill also seeks to introduce two new sections,_

namely, sections 33B and 33c, into the Act. The proposed new
section 33B will allow amendments to be made by the Registrar to
the Register, when requested to do so by the owner of a patent,
for the purpose of correcting errors or entering changes in the name
or address of such owner. The proposed new section 33c will enable
the Court, upon the application of any aggrieved person, to order
the rectification of the Register.

16. _Clause 23 of the Bill seeks to amend section 35 of the Act_

to make it clear that if annual fees are not paid in respect of a patent,
the patent shall lapse. The proposed amendment also seeks to require
the publication in the Gazette of a notice of the lapsing of the patent.


-----

PATENTS (AMENDMENT) 27

17. Clause 24 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 35A

into the Act to empower the Registrar to reinstate a lapsed patent
subject to certain conditions.

18. Clause 33 of the Bill seeks to amend section 56 of the Act

to introduce a new ground for the invalidation of a patent. Under
the proposed new paragraph (2)(e), if a person or his agent
deliberately provides or causes to be provided incomplete or
incorrect information to the Registrar under the new subsection
29A{4) and a patent is subsequently granted to such person, any
aggrieved person may apply to the Court for the invalidation of the
patent.

19. Clause 38 of the Bill seeks to amend section 79 of the Act

primarily to provide for the payment of fees as prescribed by

regulations instead of the payment of costs as the Registrar thinks

just in respect of requests for amendments to correct clerical errors

or obvious mistakes on patent applications and other documents
submitted at the Patent Registration Office.

20. Clause 39 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 79A
which allows amendments, after a patent is granted, to the
specifications of a patent or to any other document associated with
a patent for the purpose of correcting a clerical error or an obvious
mistake. This amendment is an extension of the provisions of section
79 of the Act.

21. Clause 42 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 83A
into the Act to enable the Registrar to certify that any entry, matter
or thing required to be made or done under the Act has been made
or done. It also seeks to provide for the admissibility of such
certificates in all courts. This will facilitate proceedings in courts
on matters relating to the Act.

22. Clause 44 of the Bill seeks to amend subsection 86(5) of the
Act to remove the requirement that persons who are not domiciled
or resident in Malaysia must institute or appear in suits in respect
of their patents through patent agents.

23. Clause 47 of the Bill seeks to amend section 90 of the Act
to insert express references to the grant of a patent in Sarawak and
to validate grants made in the transitional period under subsection
90(1) or 90(2) of the Act. Such references were unintentionaly
omitted and grants may have been made in the transitional period.

24. _Clause 49 of the Bill deals with transitional and saving_

provisions. This clause makes it clear that amendments relating to
preliminary and substantive examinations of patent applications will
not apply to requests for such examinations, or to such examinations,
which are still pending immediately before the amendments came
into force. The existing provisions will continue to apply to such
requests and examinations.


-----

28 BILL

25. Apart from the provisions which have been specifically dealt

with in the preceding paragraphs of this Statement, several
provisions have been included in the Bill for the purpose of
correcting errors in the national language text of the Act. Such
provisions are contained in clauses 14, 25, 28, 29, 30, 32, 35, 36,
_37 and 43 of the Bill._

26. Other amendments proposed in this Bill but not specifically

dealt with in this Statement are minor or consequential in nature.

**_FINANCIAL_** **_IMPLICATION_**

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1442.]
