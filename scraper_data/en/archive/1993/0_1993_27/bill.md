EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to provide for the implementation of two
international conventions governing compensation for damage
caused by oil spills from tankers, namely, the 1969 International
Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (Civil
Liability Convention) and the 1971 International Convention on the
Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil
Pollution Damage (Fund Convention). The Civil Liability
Convention governs the liability of shipowners for' oil pollution
damage and it establishes a comprehensive compensation scheme
for pollution damage caused by oil spills from ships. The Fund
Convention is supplementary to the Civil Liability Convention and
it provides payment of additional compensation to victims of oil
pollution when the compensation provided under the Civil Liability
Convention is inadequate.
