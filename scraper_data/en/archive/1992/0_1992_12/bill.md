EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Fisheries Act 1985 (hereinafter referred
to as "the Act").

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend the definitions of "fish-aggregation_
device", "fishing vessel", "local fishing vessel" and "pollutant" and to
introduce the definition of "traditional fishing appliance". The
proposed amendment to the definition offish-aggregation device" is


-----

FISHERIES (AMENDMENT) 15

to clarify the meaning of a fish-aggregation device. The proposed
amendment to the definition of "fishing vessel" includes vessels used
to carry fish feed in cage culture projects under the definition, thus
bringing such vessels within the purview of the licensing provisions.
The proposed amendment to the definition of "local fishing vessel"
seeks to include within the meaning of the said definition, a foreign
fishing vessel which is chartered or subchartered, leased or subleased
by a Malaysian citizen or other body established in Malaysia. The
proposed amendment to the definition of "pollutant" seeks to include
any substance which is liable to pollute not only maritime waters but
riverine waters as well. The proposed introduction of a new definition,
namely of "traditional fishing appliance" is necessary in view of the
proposed amendment to section 31.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 8 to make it an offence for any
person not issued with a licence under the Act to undertake any fishing
activity by whatever method, including in particular, the collection of
any species of fish.

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 11 to provide a presumption that
any part of a fishing appliance is to be construed as a complete fishing
appliance.

the period of appeal to the Minister to thirty days.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 14, to provide for the period of
validity of a licence to be twelve calendar months and a new paragraph

to provide that a person, not being a Malaysian citizen, found on board
any local fishing vessel in Malaysian fisheries waters is presumed to
be a crew member of such vessel.

8. Clause 8 seeks to amend subsection (1) of section 15 to add a
further situation where a foreign fishing vessel may be allowed to
conduct any techno-economic research or survey of any fishery,
namely where there is an agreement for the same between a Malaysian
citizen and owner of such vessel.

9. Clause 9 seeks to amend subsection (1) of section 16 to provide
that passage in Malaysian fisheries waters by foreign fishing vessels
shall be in accordance with rules of international law of the sea
relevant to that part of the waters which is being navigated. Subsection

fine to be imposed for any offence relating to local fishing vessel to
twenty thousand ringgit.

certain offences provided that the offence committed is the first,
second or third offence only and to allow a minimum compound of one
hundred ringgit for an offence committed under subsection (1) of
section 43 of the Act. The amendment to section 31 makes provision
to compound any offence relating to a traditional fishing appliance. A
provision is also made for the forfeiture of proceeds of sale of fish or
article of a perishable nature.

13. Clause 13 seeks to introduce a new subsection (2) to section 35
to provide that a certificate issued by the Minister responsible for
survey and mapping or the Minister responsible for defence stating
that a map, plan or chart has been approved by the Government, shall
be conclusive proof of the fact so stated.

14. Clause 14 seeks to amend section 40 to provide for the control
on the transportation of live fish between the Federal Territory of
Labuan and the States of Sabah and Sarawak, in addition to the
existing provisions which only provide for the control on the
transportation of live fish between West Malaysia and the Federal
Territory of Labuan, the States of Sabah and Sarawak.

15. Clause 15 seeks to introduce sections 4lA and 4lB into the Act.
Section 41 A seeks to establish the National Advisory Council for
Marine Park and Marine Reserve to be appointed by the Minister.
Section 41B seeks to provide the functions of the Council.

16. Clause 16 seeks to introduce new sections 47A, 47B, 47c and 47D
into the Act. Section 47A seeks to empower any fisheries officer to
investigate the commission of any offence under the Act. Sections 47B
and 47c seek to provide for the powers of such officer to require the
attendance of witnesses and to examine witnesses for the purpose of
such investigation. Section 47D seeks to provide for the procedure
where investigation carried out by a fisheries officer on any person
arrested and detained in custody cannot be completed within twenty
four hours.

17. Clause 17 seeks to amend subsection (2) of section 50 which
relates to the computation of security to be furnished for the temporary
return of any fishing vessel seized under the Act. Under the existing
provisions, the maximum fine which would be imposable in respect of


-----

FISHERIES (AMENDMENT) 17

the offence committed and the expenses incurred in the seizure and
repatriation of the crew shall be taken into account in determining the
amount of security to be furnished for the release of both local and
foreign fishing vessel. The proposed amendment seeks to provide that
the security to be furnished for the temporary return of vessel is the
aggregate value of vessel including fishing appliance, equipment, etc.

18. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 52 by specifying offences_

whereby the vessel and fishing appliance used in the commission of
the offence shall be forfeited by the Court upon a conviction.

19. Clause 19 seeks to amend section 53 by reducing the maximum

fine to be imposed for any offence under that section to twenty
thousand ringgit.

20. _Clause 20 seeks to amend section 56 of the Act consequent upon_

the amendments made to section 16.

21. Clause 21 seeks to amend section 58 by allowing the Director-
General to exempt any vessel or person from all or any of the
provisions of the Act for the purpose of survey on economic feasibility
of any fishing activity.

22. Clause 22 seeks to introduce new paragraphs (aj) and (ak) into
section 61 to empower the Minister to make regulations for the
registration of any person carried or employed on board any local
fishing vessel and the issue of an identification card to such person and
to regulate the registration of any local fishing vessel.
