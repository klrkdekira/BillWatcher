consideration.

revoke a licence issued under clause 6.

_Clause 9 seeks to empower the Controller to impose a limit on_

the duration of a licence or such conditions as he may think

off period.

performance of services during the cooling-off period. However,
where the purchaser, before the expiry of the cooling-off period,

he will be deemed to have waived his right to rescind the contract
under clause 26. However he cannot give such notice before the
expiry of seventy-two hours from the time the contract is
concluded.
