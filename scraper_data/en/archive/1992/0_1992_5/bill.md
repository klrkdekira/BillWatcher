**EXPLANATORY STATEMENT**

This Bill seeks to make better provisions for the constitution,
registration, control and regulation of co-operative societies and to
promote the development of co-operative societies in Malaysia.
Upon becoming law, it will replace the existing Co-operative
Societies Act 1948 of West Malaysia and the Co-operative Societies
Ordinances of Sabah and Sarawak. The provisions in this Bill are
based, with certain modifications and additions, on the existing cooperative laws in force in Malaysia.

2. Part I of this Bill deals with preliminary matters, such as the
definitions of certain terms used in the Bill and the appointment
of a Registrar-General and Registrars.

3. Part II of this Bill deals with registration. Clause 4 seeks to
provide for the types of co-operative societies which may be
, registered. Under this Bill, there are three types of societies which
may be registered, namely, primary societies (which consist of
individual persons only), secondary societies (which consist of
primary societies only) and tertiary societies (which consist of
secondary societies only or of secondary and primary societies).
_Clauses 5, 6 and 7 deal with conditions for registration, procedure_
for applying for registration, and the registration itself,
respectively. Clause 9 seeks to make all societies registered under
the proposed Act bodies corporate.

operative society to be admissible in evidence subject to certain
conditions being met.
