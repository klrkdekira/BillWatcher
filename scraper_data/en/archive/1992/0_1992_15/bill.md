A BILL

# intituled

An Act to amend the Petroleum Development Act 1974.

[ ]

BE IT ENACTED by the Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri
Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong with the advice
and consent of the Dewan Negara and Dewan Rakyat in
Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same,
as follows:

1. (1) This Act may be cited as the Petroleum
Development (Amendment) Act 1992.

(2) This Act shall come into force on such date as the
Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint.

2. Section 6 of the Petroleum Development Act 1974 is
amended by inserting, immediately after subsection (3),
the following new subsections (3A) and (3B):

"(3A) Subsection (3) shall not apply to any
person who is licensed under the Gas Supply
_Act_ Act 1992 to supply gas to consumers through
pipelines.

(3s) For the purpose of subsection (3A), the
terms "gas", "consumers" and "pipelines" shall
have the same meaning assigned to them
respectively by the Gas Supply Act 1992.".

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Petroleum Development Act 1974
(hereinafter referred to as "the Act").


Short title
and commencement

Amendment
of section 6.
_Act 144_

2 BILL

2. _Clause I seeks to provide for the commencement date of the_
Bill.

3. Clause 2 seeks to introduce the two new subsections (3A) and
(3e) to section 6. The proposed new subsection (3A) seeks to exclude
the provisions of subsection 6(3) of the Act from applying to any
person who is licensed under the Gas Supply Act 1992 to supply
gas to consumers through pipelines. This means that such person
will not be required to apply for permission from the Prime Minister
under subsections 6(1) and (3) of the Act for carrying on the business
of marketing or distributing of petroleum. In this way the difficulty
of having to apply for permission as well as a licence under two
separate legislation for carrying on one business can be avoided.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1732.]
