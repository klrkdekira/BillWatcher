(13) of section 3 of the Act to provide an additional ground for
disqualification for membership of the Medical Council. Clause 2
also seeks to introduce a new subsection (13A) to section 3 of the
Act to disqualify a medical practitioner whose name has been struck
off from the Register or who has been reprimanded from being
nominated or elected to be a member of the Medical Council for a
period of six years from the expiration of such suspension or from
the date of such reprimand. Clause 2 further seeks to introduce new
subsections (15), (16) and (17) to section 3 of the Act to provide
that a member of the Medical Council in respect of whom a
preliminary investigation has been commenced or a disciplinary
inquiry has been instituted shall be suspended from being such
member from the date of commencement of the investigation or the
institution of the inquiry. However if the Council finds that no case
has been made out against the member, he shall be reinstated.

3. _Clause 4 seeks to amend subsection (2) of section 13 of the Act_
to provide for the new period in which a provisionally registered
person has to undergo employment in a resident surgical post,
resident medical post and resident obstetrical and gynaecological
post. Clause 4 also seeks to delete subsection (3) of section 13 of

registered person who is the holder of the unscheduled qualification
is no longer required to undergo the additional two years experience
in a post in the public service as at present.

4. _Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new paragraph (c) to subsection_
(1) of section 19 of the Act to empower the Council to refuse the
registration of any person who is found to be unfit to perform his

an autopsy or post-mortem investigation of any deceased person.
The new section 34c further provides that the officers so authorised
are deemed to be Government Medical Officers for the purposes of
the Criminal Procedure Code or other relevant laws. This will
render post-mortem reports or medical reports by such medical
practitioners admissible as evidence in the court of law during their
absence provided that all other procedural and legal requirements
have been satisfied.

7. Clause 8 seeks to amend subsection (1) of section 35 of the Act
lo increase the general penalty provided in that subsection.

specified in the said clause as if those amendments had not been
made.

9. Clause 11 seeks to repeal the existing Part VII of the Act and
substitute a new Part VII for national purposes. The new Part VII
instead upon its commencement will continue to be in force until
Parliament, by resolution, provides otherwise.

10. _Clause 12 seeks to provide that the existing Part VII of the Act_
shall be deemed to have continued to be in force since 1st October
1986, since Part VII had ceased to be in force on 30th September
1986. In consequence, clause 12 seeks to validate any act or thing
done or any notice issued by the Director General pursuant to the
existing Part VII. However, penalties for offences are excluded from
the retrospective operation.

a consequential or minor in nature.
