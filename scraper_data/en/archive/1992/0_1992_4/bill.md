**BILL**

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to provide for the registration, control, and
inspection of care centres and for related matters. A care centre is
defined as a residential care centre and a day care centre within
the meaning of the Act. A residential care centre is defined in
_clause 2 as anv premises at which tbur or more persons (not_
relatives) are reccived for care as residents therein, whether for
reward or otherwise. A day care centre is defined as any premises
at which four or more persons (not relatives) are received for care
for a continuous period exceeding three hours between the hours
of sunrise and sunset in a day, and for at least three days in a week,
whether for rcward or otherwise. Clause 3 specif'ies the places to
which this Bili does not apply.

2. Part II deals with malters relating to registration. Under clause
_5 it is an otYence to operate or take part in the management of a_
care centre that is not registered, but there is a relaxation in respect
of existing care centres. The registering authority is the Director
General of Social Welfare, Malaysia, to whom application for
registration has to be made (clause 6). Under clause 7 the Director
General is empowered to impose conditions when registering a care
centre. Clause 8 requires the keeping of a register of residential
care centres as well as a regisler of day care centres and clause
_9 gives the public a right to inspection of the registers. Clause 10_
provides for the issuance of certificates of registration and for
matters relating to such certificates and clause I I states the
circumstances in which registration may be cancelled.

3. Part III contains provisions relating to officers and their
powers. Clause 12 gives the Minister power to appoint officers tbr
the purposes of this Bill, who will be known as "authorised
officers" (see definition in cluuse 2). The Director General and any
authorised officer are empowered to enter and inspect the premises
of registered care centres (clause 13) as well as premises reasonably
suspected of being used as or for a care centre that is not registered
_(clause 16). In the course of such inspection. they may ask_
questions and require the production of records. Clause 14 gives
the Director General the power to give wntten directions in respect
of any registered care centre for the good of the centre and the
residents and persons received for care at such centre. Failure to
comply with a direction would constitute a ground tbr the Director
General to order under clause 15 the closure of a registered care
centre. An order under clause 15 may also be made if there is
danger to any person in any premises of a registered care centre.

4. Part IV contains miscellaneous provisions including provisions
creatmg offences (clanse 18), offences by a body corporate and
by employees and agents (clause 19), giving right of appeal to the
Minister (clause 22), giving power to rhe Minister to exempt any


-----

**CARE CENTRES** 17

care centre, or any class category or description of care centres
_(clause 23), and giving power to make regulations (clause 24)._

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained,
