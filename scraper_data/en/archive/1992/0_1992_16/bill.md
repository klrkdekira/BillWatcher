EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Petroleum (Safety Measures) Act 1984
(hereinafter referred to as "the Act").

2. Clause 1 seeks to provide for the commencement date of the
Bill.

3. Clause 2 seeks to introduce a new section I 8 A to exclude the
provisions of Part V of the Act from applying to the supply of gas
to consumers through pipelines under the Gas Supply Act 1992. Part
V of the Act provides for the transportation of petroleum by
pipelines. With the introduction of the new section I 8 A it will mean
that gas which is to be supplied to consumers through pipelines
under paragraphs 1 _(3)(a) and (b) of the Gas Supply Act 1992, that_
is, downstream of the last flange of the city gate station or from
the storage tank or cylinder specifically used for reticulation of gas
to any apparatus in any premises, will not be covered by the Act.
This will avoid overlapping jurisdiction between the two Acts.

4. Clause 3 seeks to introduce a new section 27A to Part VI of
the Act. Amongst other things, this will exclude the provisions of
subsection 19(1) of the Act from applying to any person who holds
a licence under the Gas Supply Act 1992 for the supply of gas to
consumers through pipelines from the storage tank or cylinders
specifically used for reticulation of gas to any apparatus in any
premises. This will ensure that a person who has already obtained
a licence under the Gas Supply Act 1992 for its purposes will not

(AMENDMENT)

be required to obtain another licence under the Act for the storage
or handling of petroleum.

With the introduction of the new section 27 A it will also mean

that all the provisions on the storage and handling of petroleum in
Part VI in relation to the supply of gas to consumers through
pipelines will be dealt with separately under the Gas Supply Act
1992 and the regulations to be made thereunder.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1731.]
