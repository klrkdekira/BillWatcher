EXPLANATORY STATEMENT This Bill

seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code ("Act 593").

2.  Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of
the proposed Act.


-----

16 _Bill_

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend subsection 2(1) of Act 593. This amendment seeks_

to substitute the definition of "youthful offender" to mean a person convicted
of an offence punishable with fine or imprisonment who is of the age of
eighteen and above but below the age of twenty-one.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend subsection 10(1) of Act 593 to remove the limit_

of seven miles in the provision which states that a person who has committed
an offence in any place within any State which is near the boundary of any other
State is not entitled as of right to be tried within the first-mentioned State.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 13 of Act 593 to include offences under_

sections 376, 377c and 377E of the Penal Code as offences in respect of which
information must be given.

6. _Clause 5  seeks to amend Part IV of Act 593. This amendment seeks to_

introduce a new Chapter, namely Chapter XIIA which consists of new sections
106A to 106c, into Part IV of Act 593. The new Chapter XIIA deals with special
ancillary powers of the police and the Public Prosecutor in relation to terrorism
offences.

The new section 106A defines certain expressions used in Chapter XIIA,

including the expression "terrorism offence".

The new section 106B seeks to empower a police officer to arrest without

warrant any person who has committed or is committing or whom he has
reasonable grounds for suspecting to have committed or to be committing a
terrorism offence.

The new section 106c seeks to empower the Public Prosecutor to authorize

a police officer to intercept certain communications if the Public Prosecutor
considers that the communications are likely to contain information relating to
the commission of a terrorism offence. The information so obtained, whether
before or after the person concerned is charged, shall be admissible at his trial
in evidence.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend Chapter XIII of Act 593 by introducing a new_
section 107A to allow any person who have given information of an offence
under section 107 to request the police to give a report on the status of investigation.
The police is only required to give the status report if the offence is a seizable
offence, four weeks have lapsed from the date of the information and it does
not contain any matter that is likely to adversely affect the investigation or
prosecution of the offence. The informant may report any failure on the part
of the police to furnish the status report to the Public Prosecutor. The Public
Prosecutor shall direct the Officer in charge of the Police District to furnish
the status report to the informant. Failure to comply with the direction of the
Public Prosecutor is an offence.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 110 of Act 593 by inserting subsection (4)_

to make it an offence if the police officer fails to submit a report to the Public
Prosecutor of information of a seizable offence received by him.


-----

_Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)_ 17

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend subsection 111(1) of Act 593 to allow a police_

officer to order any person who is acquainted with the circumstances of the case
under his investigation to appear before him irrespective of whether that person
is within the limits of the police district in which he is making the investigation.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 120 of Act 593 to tighten the current_

provisions. The police officer making the investigation shall submit a report of
his investigation together with the investigation papers regarding the investigation
to the Public Prosecutor within one week from the expiry of the period of three
months from the date of the information given under section 107. Failure to do
so is an offence.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend subsection 127A(1)_ of Act 593 to extend the

application of the section to extra-territorial offences under the new Chapter
VIA of the Penal Code and to add additional grounds on which extra-territorial
criminal jurisdiction may be sought.

12. _Clause 1.1 seeks to amend section 173 of Act 593 to specifically provide_

for the Court's duty to explain the three options of defence to the accused.

13. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 256 of Act 593. The amendments seek_

to make consistent the usage of the word "accused" throughout the section and
to reflect the usage of the national language in the Courts.

14. _Clause 13 seeks to introduce a new section, namely section 272B,_ into

Act 593 to enable a witness, other than the accused, with leave of the court,
to give video or live evidence through a live video or live television link in
any trial or inquiry if it is expedient in the interest of justice.

15. _Clause 14 seeks to amend section 289 of Act 593 to allow the punishment_

of whipping to be carried out on a male offender who is or more than fifty years
of age if he is sentenced to whipping under section 376, 377c or 377E of the
Penal Code.
