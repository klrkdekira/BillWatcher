10. _Clause 11 of the Bill seeks to amend section 17 of Act 4 to enable an_

insured person to fulfill the qualification for the invalidity pension where the
invalidity had occurred earlier but the invalidity notice has not been submitted
to the Social Security Organization due to ignorance or other factors which are
not the insured person's fault. This amendment would also take into account
the months in which contributions in respect of the employee have not being
paid because the employee receives temporary disablement benefit due to
employment injury and the employer is not paying his salary.

11. _Clause 14 of the Bill seeks to amend paragraph 20A(1)(a) of Act 4 to_

enable survivors' pension to be paid to a widow or widower for the duration
of her or his life. However, the widow or widower will only be paid one
survivors' pension, being the pension at a higher rate, should she or he be
entitled to more than one such pension.

12. _Clause 21 of the Bill seeks to amend Act 4 by introducing new section_

32A into the Act. The new section 32A provides for a Special Medical Board

waiting period for a revision of the decision made by a medical board or an
appellate medical board from five years to three years.

14. _Clause 23 of the Bill seeks to amend section 49 of Act 4 by introducing_

an additional proviso to that section. The purpose of the additional proviso is
to encourage insured persons to work actively and thus contribute to the country's
economic growth. At the present, invalidity pension is suspended if and as long
as the invalid pensioner is employed and due to the new employment he is again
insured under the Act. With this amendment, he will continue to get the pension
as long as he does not earn more than one third of his average wage before his
invalidity.

15. _Clause 24 of the Bill seeks to amend section 50 of Act 4 by introducing_

57B and 57c into the Act. The new section 57B places on the Organization the
responsibility for the recovery and collections of repayments of educational
loans. Such loans are treated as civil debts. The new section 57c seeks to
empower the Organization to appoint agents for the collection of the loans.

17. _Clause 30 of the Bill seeks to amend subsections 83(5) and (6) of Act 4_

to enable a panel of persons to be appointed by the Minister from which
assessors will be selected for the purpose of representing the employers and
employees on the Social Security Appeal Board. These amendments will make
it easier for such Board to be constituted.

## Employees' Social Security (Amendment) 27

18. _Clause 31 of the Bill seeks to amend section 94 of Act 4 to enable the_

Organization to prosecute an employer who fails to pay part of any contribution
or interest on the contribution payable under the Act.


19. _Clause 32 of the Bill seeks to amend subsections 94A(2)_ of Act 4 to

provide that a Magistrate could only allow six installments for the payment of
arrears of contribution or interest on contributions. This clause also seeks to
introduce a new subsection (3) into section 94A of the Act to enable the Court
to order the employer who is found guilty by the Court to submit the required
accident report to the Organization.

20. _Clause 33 of the Bill seeks to amend section 95 of Act 4 so that the_

prosecution for an offence under the Act can only be instituted by or with the
consent of the Public Prosecutor.

21. _Clause 34 of the Bill seeks to amend Act 4 by introducing a new section_
95A into the Act to empower the Director General or any officer authorized by
him in writing to compound any offence committed under the regulations made
under the Act.

22. _Clause 35 of the Bill seeks to amend Act 4 by introducing a new section_
103A into the Act to empower the Director General to dispose of the Organization's
documents after the documents have been copied onto an electronic medium.
This is proposed in order to reduce storage space and costs. However, the
Director General cannot exercise that power before the expiry of three years
from such copying. The new section 103A also provides that such electronic
copies would be admissible as evidence.

23. _Clause 37 of the Bill seeks to amend Act 4 by introducing a new section_

108 into the Act. The new section imposes joint and several liabilities on
a
director of a company or partner of a firm or office-bearer of an association
of persons if the company, firm or association fails to pay contribution or
interest on contributions payable by it under the Act as an employer. This would
enable the Organization to recover the arrears of contribution and interest
thereon if the company, firm or association is dissolved.


24. _Clause 38 of the Bill seeks to amend the First Schedule to Act 4. At_

present a person who earns more than two thousand ringgit a month in an
industry to which the Act applies is not treated as an employee for the purpose
of the Act. The amendment seeks to increase that limit to three thousand ringgit
so that more employees will be able to enjoy the benefit under the Act.

25. Other amendments not specifically referred to in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
