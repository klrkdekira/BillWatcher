# Constitution (Amendment) 3

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Federal Constitution.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to amend Article 125 of the Federal Constitution to increase_
the age of retirement of a judge from sixty-five years to sixty-six years, consistent
with the increase in the age of compulsory retirement of public officers by one
year. Consequently, the reference to the age of sixty-five years in the proviso
to Clause (1A) of Article 122 of the Federal Constitution needs also to be
changed to sixty-six years as proposed in clause 2 of this Bill.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend the Ninth Schedule to the Federal Constitution_
to make water supplies and services and preservation of heritage concurrent
matters.

There is an urgent need for the Federal Government to manage and regulate

the water industry in terms of licensing and regulating water operators in order
to bring about a focused and uniform approach in all aspects thereof. For this
purpose, a central body, the National Water Services Commission, will subsequently
be established and a federal law on water services industry be enacted.

The active and direct involvement in water supplies and operations by the

Federal Government which for such time has been providing funding to the
States for their respective development and maintenance of water infrastructure
assets will result in improved efficiency and effectiveness in the water industry.
The proposed amendments will not affect the existing powers of the States to
control and regulate water catchments areas, water sources and river basins.

The amendment proposed to the Ninth Schedule is to exclude the item on

water supplies and services from the State List and place it instead as an item
in the Concurrent List. The proposed amendment to the Supplement to State
List for the States of Sabah and Sarawak is to state that water will continue
to remain a State matter for the two States.

Preservation of heritage will also be included as one of the items in the

Concurrent List so that the Federal Government will be able to play a larger
and more meaningful role in heritage preservation.

5: _Clause 5_ seeks to amend the Tenth Schedule to the Federal Constitution
whereby revenue from licenses connected with water supplies and services and
receipts from water tariffs from consumer will no longer accrue to the States
other than for Sabah and Sarawak.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN(U[2])2393]
