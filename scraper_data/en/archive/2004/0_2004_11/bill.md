EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Hire-Purchase Act 1967 [Act 212]. Currently Act 212
provides only for a fixed rate of terms charges for hire-purchase transactions.
This Bill introduces an option for a variable rate of terms charges for
hire-purchase transactions. The variable rate of terms charges are proposed to be
quoted at a margin percentage above the base lending rate. Act 212 also currently
allows hire-purchase agreements to be altered by signing or initialing the agreement
opposite the alteration only. This Bill allows any alterations of the hire-purchase
agreements to be done through a supplementary agreement.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the provision on the commencement of_

the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 212 to introduce the definition of_

"base lending rate".

4. _Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new Part IIA into Act 212. The proposed new_

Part seeks to give an option to hirers to choose either for a fixed rate of terms
charges or a variable rate of terms charges. The proposed new Part also seeks to
provide for the owner's rights to revise the base lending rate and to require the
owner to serve a notice to the hirer informing any changes in the base lending rate
and consequences thereof. Where the base lending rate is revised by the owner,
the hirer is given the option to either retain the existing amount of instalments and
vary the number of instalments or to vary the amount of instalments and retain the
number of instalments.

5. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 39 of Act 212 to allow alterations to a_

hire-purchase agreement through a supplementary agreement.

6. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are amendments

which are consequential or minor in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
