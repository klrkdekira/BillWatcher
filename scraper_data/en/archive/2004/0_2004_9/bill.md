EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority Act
1965 ("Act 141").

2. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 1A of Act 141 to introduce new definitions_

and to amend definitions of certain terms used in the Act.

3. _Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new subsection (7) into section 2 of Act 141_

to provide for the protection of members of the Authority from personal liability
in respect of matters that may arise when such members administer the affairs
of the Authority. A new section 6c, as proposed in clause 10, seeks to provide
for the protection of officers of the Authority, including the Director General
and authorized officers, from any action or proceeding in respect of any act
done by them in good faith in carrying out the provisions of the Act.

4. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 3 of the Act to provide the Authority with_

additional powers. These include the power to determine matters relating to the
provision of credit facilities by the Authority. It is also proposed in this clause
that the power of the Authority under paragraph 3(2)(d) of Act 141 be further
enhanced to enable it to establish, construct, equip, maintain, let, lease, control,
manage or operate markets or market premises for the purposes of facilitating
and regulating the sale of agricultural produce.

5. Amendments proposed in clauses 7, 8, 9, 12 and 14 seek to delete sections

6, 6A, 6B, 11A and 12A of the Act since the Statutory Bodies (Discipline And
Surcharge) Act 2000 applies to the Authority in respect of matters relating to
the discipline, termination of service in public interest and surcharge of officers
and servants of the Authority.

6. Amendments to section 9 of Act 141, as proposed in clause 11, provide

for the payment into the Fund of additional sources of money received by the
Authority when it performs the additional functions proposed in clause 5.

7. _Clause 16 seeks to introduce a new section 15A into Act 141 to provide_

for the compounding of offences under the Act or the regulations made under
the Act. These are offences that are prescribed as compoundable under the
amendments proposed in clause 13.


-----

14 _Bill_

8. The powers of an authorized officer or police officer to search any premises

with a warrant under section 19 of the Act and to investigate an offence under
section 22 of the Act are further enhanced by amendments proposed in clauses
_18 and 20, respectively._

9. _Clause 23 seeks to introduce a new section 24A into Act 141 that makes_

it an offence for any person to make or give false, inaccurate or misleading
declarations, returns, certificates or other documents or information.

10. _Clause 26 contains saving and transitional provisions._

11. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
