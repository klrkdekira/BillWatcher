the proposed Act.


-----

8 _Bill_

3. _Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new subsection (3) into section 4 of Act 258_

5. _Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 6A into Act 258 to provide for_

the disqualification of trustees who have been registered under the Act.

incorporation is conclusive evidence of the incorporation of a body corporate
so long as the certificate is not revoked.
