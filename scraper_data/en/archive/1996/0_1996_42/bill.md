EXPLANATORY STATEMENT


Sentence.


This Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (the "Code")
as a consequence of the decision of the Federal Court in July 1996
in the case of Arulpragasan a/I Sandaraju dan Pendakwa Raya
("Arulpragasan's case").

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 173 which deals with summary_
trials in the subordinate courts.


-----

6 _Bill_

Amendments are proposed to paragraph (f) of section 173 of the
Code to make it clear that at the close of the prosecution's case,
what the Court has to consider is whether or not the prosecution
has made out a prima facie case against the accused person. This
approach is consistent with the approach taken by the courts in
several other Commonwealth countries. In Malaysia, particularly
since the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Haw Tua Tau
_v. Public Prosecutor in 1981, this has also been the approach taken_
by the Supreme Court and the Federal Court (except in the case of
_Khoo Hi Chiang v. Public Prosecutor in 1993) prior to Arulpragasan's_
case.

The amendments proposed to paragraph (m) of section 173 of
the Code provides that it is only at the conclusion of the whole case
that the Court must consider all the evidence adduced before it
(including the evidence adduced by the accused in his defence) and
determine whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt.

3. Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 180 of the Code to
achieve the same purpose as that sought to be achieved by amendments
to paragraph (f) of section 173 of the Code.

4. _Clause 6 seeks to introduce a new section I82A into the Code_
to provide for the same matters as are in the proposed amendments
to paragraph (m) of section 173 of the Code.

5. Other amendments proposed in this Bill are—

_(a) amendments for the purpose of reducing the differences_
between the trial procedure in the High Court and the
trial procedure in the subordinate courts;

_(b) consequential amendments necessitated by the amendments_
proposed to paragraphs (f) and (m) of section 173 and to
section 180 and the proposed introduction of section 182A;
and

_(c) drafting amendments and other amendments which are_
minor in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN.(U[2])1952.]
