EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to make comprehensive provisions for the licensing
and regulation of insurers, insurance brokers and adjusters. Upon
becoming law, it will replace the existing Insurance Act 1963 (repealed
Act). The provisions in this Bill are based, with certain modifications
and additions, on the existing provisions in the repealed Act.

2. Part I of this Bill deals with preliminary matters, such as the
definitions of certain terms used in the Bill and empowering the
Bank with all the functions conferred on it by the Bill, including
authorising an employee or person to perform any of its functions.


-----

INSURANCE 137

3. Part II provides for the licensing of persons carrying on insurance
business, insurance broking business or adjusting business.

_Clause 4 seeks to classify insurance business into general business_
and life business.

_Clause 5 provides that employees retirement scheme, business_
carried on by mutual benefit society under the Societies Act 1966
and both export credit and other credit insurance business carried
on by Malaysia Export Credit Insurance Berhad (MECIB) are not
insurance business. MECIB, will therefore operate outside the purview
of the Bill.

_Clause 6 empowers the Bank to prohibit or restrict a licensed_
insurer from carrying on specific description of insurance business
in order to prevent imprudent underwriting.

_Clause 7 prohibits a licensed insurer from carrying on annuity_
certain or investment-linked insurance business except with the
approval of the Bank because these types of insurance have to be
regulated differently.

_Clause 8 sets out the activities which constitute insurance business._

_Clauses 9 and 10 prohibit a person from carrying on licensed_
business i.e. insurance business, insurance broking business or
adjusting business or holding out as an insurer, insurance broker
or adjuster, unless licensed, respectively. Subclause 9(2) exempts
aviation or maritime loss adjusters from being licensed under this
Bill.

_Clause 11 prohibits the use of the words "insurance", "assurance"_
or "underwriter" or any other words capable of being construed as
indicating the carrying on of any of the licensed businesses without
the Bank's approval. This prohibition does not apply to a licensee
and a person exempted under subclause 11(2).

_Clause 12 prohibits a licensed insurer from carrying on both life_
business and general business. This prohibition does not apply to
a licensed professional reinsurer or a licensed insurer which is already
lawfully carrying on both businesses. Since life and general business
are substantially different, it is considered desirable to separate the
two activities. However, life insurers will be permitted to transact
health insurance business.

_Clause 13 provides for the Minister to be the licensing authority_
for insurers and for the Bank to be the licensing authority for insurance
brokers and adjusters.


-----

under this Bill.

financial strength.

_Subclause 18(3) provides for the minimum paid-up share capital_
of an insurance broker and adjuster to be prescribed by the Bank.

_Clauses 19 and 20 set out the requirements as to statement of_
capital and prospectus.

than its principal place of business and an annual licence fee for
its other offices.

_Clause 22 provides for mandatory membership of appropriate_
trade association to encourage self-regulation by the insurance industry.

twelve months from the date of its licence.

_Clause 28 restricts licensees from carrying on unrelated activities._

_Clause 29 requires a licensee to obtain the written approval of_
the Bank before amending its licensing particulars, including its
constituent documents.

business unless approved by the Bank but a licensed insurer is

revoked.

not later than 31 March each year.

subsidiary or office in or outside Malaysia without the approval of
the Bank and provide for the application for such approval.

and matters related to insurance funds and shareholders' funds.

_Clauses 38 and 39 require a licensed insurer to establish separate_
insurance funds for its Malaysian and for its foreign policies for
life and general business and the licensed insurer has to allocate
its policies to the respective insurance funds.

_Clause 40 requires incomes to be credited to the respective_
insurance funds.

_Clause 41 requires that an insurance fund should at all times be_
adequate to meet its liabilities and that assets of an insurance fund

from the insurer's other assets and excludes certain intangible assets
from being included as assets of an insurance fund.

-----

140 BILL

solvency within its insurance fund unless approved otherwise by
the Bank. This is an important safety cushion for policy owners.

_Clause 47 requires a licensed insurer to maintain a register of_
policies and a register of insurance claims. This will make it an
offence to delay or omit to recognise liabilities of the licensed

of title or right to an asset to be held in its corporate name or
subject to the Bank's approval, in the name of its nominee.

properties as security, restrict the pledging of assets of a licensed
insurer and a licensed insurance broker and require the disclosure
of interest in credit facility by director, chief executive officer or

insurance broker to record any declaration made under clause 54
or 55.

sound insurance principles and empowers the Bank to give directions

arrangements are genuine and are in the best interests of the policy
owners.

6. Part V deals with the direction and control of defaulting insurers
by the Minister and the Bank.

_Clause 58 sets up an early warning system by requiring a licensed_
insurer which is just complying with solvency margin but having
adverse business results or which is deficient in solvency margin
to notify the Bank and submit a plan to improve its financial condition
and empowers the Bank to issue directions. If there is no surplus
of assets over liabilities, the Bank may petition for its winding up
after giving it a hearing.


-----

INSURANCE 141

_Clause 59 empowers the Bank to take action where a licensed_
insurer is operating in an imprudent manner or contravenes the law
or is deficient in solvency margin or its director or officer acts in
a prejudicial manner. Subclause 59(3) empowers the Bank with the

taken up by present shareholders of the licensed insurer.

insurer deficient in solvency margin with regard to its business or
to suspend its licence or to apply to Court to stay a particular class
of actions with regard to the licensed insurer's business for six
months, while giving the licensed insurer the opportunity to make
representation.

7. Part VI deals with the management of licensees.

_Clause 66 empowers a licensee to call for information on beneficial_
ownership of its shares or shares of the company holding its shares
thus ensuring transparency in the shareholding.

_Clause 67 makes it necessary to secure the approval of the Minister_
(for a licensed insurer) or Bank (for a licensed insurance broker

leading to an aggregate shareholding of more than five per cent in

_Subclause 67(2) prohibits a person who has obtained the approval_
of the Minister or the Bank, as the case may be, for the acquisition
or disposal of any interest in shares of a licensee or its controller

oath or affirmation by the investigating officer and be required to
furnish a statement in writing made on oath or affirmation setting
out any information which may be required under the notice.
_Subclauses (2) to (6) contain various other provisions in relation_
to an examination under this clause.

_Clause 108 provides that the Bank may either on its own initiative,_
or upon the request of a police officer or any other public officer
supply to that officer a copy of any document seized, detained or
taken possession of or any record of examination or any written
statement made on oath or affirmation.

_Clause 109 provides that an investigating officer shall be deemed_
to be a public servant for the purposes of the Penal Code, and to
be a public officer for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure Code
or any other written law which the Minister may, on the
recommendation of the Bank, prescribe.

11. Part X deals with matters relating to the winding up of insurers.

_Clause 110 provides that in addition to the Companies Act 1965_
other than sections 176, 237, 241, 242, 246 and 278 of that Act,
this Part applies to the winding up of an insurer, including an insurer
whose licence has been revoked or whose winding up has commenced
but has not been completed.

_Clause 111_ prohibits a local insurer from being wound up
voluntarily except after it has transferred the whole of its business
to another insurer under clause 128. A local insurer is required to
notify the Bank of the commencement of its voluntary winding up.

_Clause 112 empowers the Bank to petition for the winding up_
of an insurer, requires a petitioner other than the Bank to deliver
a copy of the petition to the Bank and allows the Bank to appear
and be heard in all proceedings.


-----

INSURANCE 147

_Clause 113 requires a petitioner to give the Bank notice of all_
proceedings relating to the petition and deliver to the Bank a copy
of the documents and records relating to the proceedings.

_Clause 114 sets out the additional circumstances under which an_
insurer may be wound up, i.e. if a petition is made where the licensed
insurer does not present a satisfactory plan to restore its margin of
solvency or following an order of the Minister under paragraph
_59(4)(b) or if the insurer's licence has been revoked under Clause_
_31._

_Clause 115 provides for the Court to appoint a person specified_
by the Bank as liquidator or provisional liquidator.

_Clause 116 requires the liquidator to function under the direction_
and supervision of the Bank taking into account the technical nature
of insurance business and the interests of policy owners and claimants.

_Clause 117 stipulates that the liquidator's remuneration will be_
determined by the Court on the recommendation of the Bank,

_Clauses 118 and 119 require the submission of an insurer's statement_
of affairs and the preliminary report and the prescribed form referred
to in section 235 and subsection 281(1) of the Companies Act 1965
respectively to the Bank at the time they are submitted to the
relevant authorities.

_Clause 120 provides that in the winding up of an insurer, the_
valuation of its assets and liabilities shall be on a basis determined
by the Bank and excludes the application of the law relating to
bankruptcy.

_Clause 121 provides for the termination of all policies issued by_
an insurer effective from the date of the winding up order. The
policy owner can only claim as a debt a refund of his premiums
in proportion to the unexpired period of his general policy, or the
actuarial valuation reserve of his life policy, as the case may be.
The liquidator is required to notify each policy owner of such cessation
by ordinary mail and by advertisement.

_Clause 122 provides that the assets of an insurance fund are_
available to meet its liabilities to all policy owners and claimants
under policies of that class of insurance business. These liabilities
have priority over all unsecured liabilities other than preferential
debts under subsection 292(1) of the Companies Act 1965 to the
extent that they are apportioned to that insurance fund. Subclause
_(2) provides that the assets of any Malaysian insurance fund shall_
be applied for meeting liabilities of that fund. The same applies to


-----

148 BILL

a foreign insurance fund. Where the assets of an insurance fund
exceed its liabilities, the surplus assets can be applied proportionately
to meet the liabilities of the insurer's other insurance funds which
are deficient. Any deficiency subsisting in an insurance fund after
such application can be met out of the other assets of the insurer
in priority over other unsecured liabilities other than preferential
debts under the Companies Act 1965.

_Clause 123 enables a liquidator of an insurer which is being_
wound up to pay in good faith to any of its claimants without
requiring strict proof of debt of such claims to facilitate payment.

_Clause 124 describes offences by a past or present director, agent,_
employee, or contributory of an insurer which is being wound up.
The offences are set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this clause.

_Clause 125 empowers the liquidator of a life insurer to carry on_
its existing life business without the authority of the Court or the
committee of inspection. The life business is carried on with a view
to its transfer as a going concern to another insurer so that the
policy owners will be least affected. However, the liquidator is not
allowed to effect any new policy. Subclause (2) allows the liquidator
to apply to the Court for an order to reduce the amount of liabilities
under its life policies and other liabilities for the purpose of transferring
the business.

_Clause 126 provides for the Rules Committee to make rules in_
relation to the winding up of insurers.

12. Part XI deals with the transfer of the whole of an insurer's
insurance business or part of it.

_Clause 127 defines the words "transferee", "transferor" and_
"scheme" for the interpretation of this Part.

_Clause 128 provides for the transfer of insurance business by a_
scheme approved by the Bank and confirmed by the Court. However,
confirmation from the Court will not be required for the transfer
of a licensed local insurer's business outside Malaysia. Any transfer
to a public company not licensed as an insurer shall take effect only
after it is so licensed.

_Clause 129 requires the transferor to submit documents relating_
to the transfer scheme to the Bank.

_Clause 130 empowers the Bank to reject or approve the scheme_
of transfer with such modifications as it may specify.


-----

INSURANCE 149

_Clause 131 requires the publication of a notice of the scheme_
of transfer in the Gazette and two daily newspapers published in
Malaysia, one of which has to be in the national language also
stating where the scheme is open for inspection and that any person
affected by it may object to the scheme by writing to the Bank.

_Clause 132 allows the transferor, with the approval of the Bank,_
to modify the scheme of transfer in case of any objection being
raised.

_Clause 133 requires the transferor to petition the Court for_
confirmation of the scheme as approved by the Bank.

_Clause 134 provides for the Bank to be a party to proceedings_
where it is not the applicant to the Court and requires the applicant
to notify the Bank of all proceedings relating to the application.
Further, the Bank can be heard, and can call, examine and crossexamine any witnesses, in all proceedings.

_Clause 135 provides that the confirmation of the scheme of transfer_
by the Court has the effect of vesting the transferor's rights and
titles in its assets in the transferee and making the transferee fully
responsible for the liabilities transferred. In the case of any alienated
land, or any share or interest in alienated land, being vested by the
order of the Court in the transferee, subclause (2) sets out the respective
procedures which will apply in West Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak,
for the vesting to be registered under the respective land law applicable.

_Clause 136 seeks to make the transferor and transferee jointly_
and severally liable to reimburse the Bank for any expenses incurred
under this Part.

_Clause 137 prohibits the insurer from paying remuneration to_
any person out of the assets of an insurance fund in relation to a
scheme of transfer.

_Clause 138 requires the transferee to lodge certain documents_
with the Bank, such documents are set out in paragraphs (a) to (e)
of this clause.

_Clause 139 restricts a licensed insurance broker or a licensed_
adjuster from transferring its business without the approval of the
Bank in order to protect the interests of its clients.

13. Part XII makes provisions relating to policies of licensed
insurers.

_Clause 140 prohibits a person from insuring property or liability_
with an insurer other than a licensed general insurer. This is to
prevent an avoidable outflow of premiums from Malaysia and to


-----

150 BILL

ensure that insurance of property located in Malaysia, including a
ship or aircraft registered in Malaysia, and insurance of liability of
a person resident in Malaysia to a third party is effected with general
insurers licensed under the Bill. However, if the Bank is satisfied
that insurance of a property or liability is not available from any
licensed general insurer, it may approve for the insurance to be
effected outside Malaysia. In order to regulate the insurance of
property or liability, subclause (4) empowers the Bank to require
a person to furnish it with information relating to such insurance.

_Clause 141 prohibits a licensed general insurer from assuming_
any risk unless it has received the premium payable. This clause
empowers the Bank to prescribe the description of general insurance
business to which this prohibition applies and the manner and time
within which the premium is payable. Premium received by a person
on behalf of a licensed general insurer is deemed to be received
by the licensed general insurer and that person is required to remit
the amount to the licensed general insurer within the time prescribed
by the Bank. This provision protects a policy owner who has paid
his premium to an insurance agent. For the purpose of
_subclause (1), the licensed general insurer is at risk upon its insurance_
agent's receipt of the premium. The licensed general insurer is required
to pay any refund premium due on such business directly to the
policy owner.

_Clause 142 prohibits a licensed life insurer from issuing a life_
policy unless the premium rate for the life policy is certified as
suitable by its appointed actuary. Subclause (2) requires a licensed
life insurer to lodge with the Bank particulars of a new life policy
product together with its certification by the appointed actuary at
least thirty days before offering the life policy to the public. The
Bank may prohibit the life policy from being offered to the public
or require its modification. A licensed life insurer is prohibited
from paying commission at a rate greater than the rate specified
by the appointed actuary.

_Clause 143 empowers the Bank to direct a licensed life insurer_
to furnish the Bank with an actuary's report on the suitability of
the policy terms and rates of premium for any life policy or such
other matters as the Bank may specify and to issue suitable directions
after considering such report.

A licensed insurer is prohibited under clause 144 from adopting
a tariff of premium rates, policy terms and conditions for any policy
except with the approval of the Bank. Subclause (2) requires a
licensed insurer to submit such information on its insurance business
to an association of licensed insurers as the Bank may approve.
_Clause 145 empowers the Bank to require a licensed insurer or an_
association of licensed life or general insurers to review premium
rates or to justify the rate charged.


-----

INSURANCE 151

_Clause 146 requires a licensed life insurer to issue on or with_
the life policy a printed notice stating that proof of age of the life
insured may be required prior to the payment of benefits under the
life policy if proof of age is a condition precedent to the payment
of the sum insured.

_Clause 147 provides that a mis-statement of age of the life insured_
in a life policy does not cause that life policy to be avoided but
allows the licensed life insurer to vary the sum insured, the bonuses
allotted to the life policy, or the premium to rectify the error.

_Clause 148 allows a policy owner to return a policy within fifteen_
days after its delivery without having to give any reason and the
licensed life insurer has to refund the premium subject only to the
deduction of medical examination expenses it has incurred. A life
policy is deemed to be returned to the licensed life insurer on the
date it is received or is posted.

_Clause 149 empowers the Bank to require a licensed life insurer_
to submit to it any proposal form, policy or brochure used by a
licensed life insurer and where the Bank considers it necessary, to
direct the licensed life insurer to discontinue the use of the same
until modified as specified.

_Clause 150 clearly spells out the duty on a proposer for insurance_
to disclose matters which would affect the decision of the licensed
insurer on whether to accept the risk and the rates and terms to be
applied or other relevant matters. However, this duty of disclosure
does not apply to those matters set out in paragraphs (a) to (d) of
_subclause (2). It also prohibits a licensed insurer or its agent from_
improperly inducing a person into a contract of insurance.

_Clause 151 provides that a person who solicits or negotiates a_
contract of insurance is deemed to be an agent of the licensed
insurer for the purpose of the formation of the contract and his
knowledge is deemed to be the knowledge of the licensed insurer.
The same applies to that agent's statement and act done in that
capacity.

_Clause 152 requires the person effecting the insurance of the life_
of anyone to have an insurable interest in that life at the time the
insurance is effected. The policy moneys paid, in instalments or
otherwise, under the life policy must not exceed the amount of that
insurable interest at the time the event resulting in the payment of
policy benefits occurs. However, such restriction does not apply
where the person is effecting insurance on his own life or that of
persons mentioned in subclause (2), that is to say, that person's
spouse, child or ward being under the age of majority at the time
the insurance is effected, that person's employee and anyone on
whom that person is at that time wholly or partly dependent.


-----

152 BILL

_Clause 153 allows a minor who is ten years or more of age but_
less than sixteen years to effect, with the written consent of his
parent or guardian, a life policy on his own life or upon another
life in which he has an insurable interest or take an assignment of
a life policy. In the case of a minor who is sixteen years of age,
he may buy a life policy or assign the life policy without requiring
the consent of his parent or guardian.

_Clause 154 provides that policy moneys payable under a life_
policy must be paid without any deduction for sums not due under
the life policy unless the person entitled to those moneys has given
his consent. The same applies to moneys payable on the surrender
of a life policy.

_Clause 155 allows a policy owner to surrender a single premium_
life policy at any time after its inception or in the case of any other
life policy, after it has been in force for three years or more and
he is entitled to receive the surrender value of the life policy determined
in the manner prescribed. However, a licensed life insurer may
provide a surrender value for a life policy which has been in force
for less than three years.

_Clause 156 provides that a life policy which has been in force_
for three years or more will not lapse or be forfeited because of
non-payment of premium. The life policy will have effect subject
to modifications as to the period for which it is to be in force or
the benefits receivable under it or both as advised by the licensed
life insurer to the policy owner.

_Clause 157 requires a licensed insurer to state in each policy the_
amount of premium charged for the insurance. A licensed life insurer
is required to state in a life policy whether it is or is not a participating
policy and that the policy owner may surrender the life policy under
_clause 155 and be entitled to receive the surrender value._

_Clause 158 allows a policy owner to elect to exchange his life_
policy for a paid-up policy.

_Clause 159 provides that the rights conferred by clauses 155,_
_156 and 158 are in addition to the policy owner's other rights,_
whether under the policy or otherwise.

_Clause 160 empowers the Bank to prescribe the manner in which_
a licensed life insurer carries on life insurance business where premium
is collected at the policy owner's address by its employees and
payment of premium to such employees is deemed to be payment
to the licensed insurer.


-----

INSURANCE 153

_Clause 161 requires a licensed insurer to pay a minimum compound_
interest of four per cent per annum or such other rate as may be
prescribed by the Bank on the amount of life insurance or personal
accident death benefit policy moneys not paid promptly. Such interest
will be charged upon the expiry of sixty days from the date of the
licensed insurer's receipt of the claim application until the date of
payment. This clause also applies to payment of policy moneys
under Part XIII.

14. Part XIII provides for the payment of policy moneys under
a life policy or a personal accident policy. The intention is to expedite
payment of policy moneys upon death of the person insured,

_Clause 162 provides for the application of this Part to a life_
policy and a personal accident policy.

_Clauses 163, 164,165,166,167, 168 and 169 empower a policy_
owner to nominate a natural person to receive policy moneys payable
upon his death under the policy and to revoke such nomination,
provide for the payment of policy moneys where there is nomination
or where there is no nomination, creation of a trust in favour of
a nominee who is a spouse, child or parent (in the case of an
unmarried policy owner only) of the policy owner, provide for a
nominee who is not a spouse, child or parent of the policy owner
to receive the policy moneys as an executor and not solely as a
beneficiary, provide the claim of an assignee and pledgee to have
priority over the claim of a nominee and also provide for the payment
of policy moneys where there is no nomination, respectively.

_Clause 170 provides for the method of payment where a nominee_
or a person to whom policy moneys are payable is a person who
is incompetent to contract.

_Clause 171 makes it mandatory on the person receiving payment_
under clause 169 to deal with the policy moneys as executor.

to the liquidator within six months to be eligible for relief from the
fund.

_Clause 180 enables the Bank to determine the percentage of a_
claim which may be paid out of a fund or that no payment is made
from a fund where the moneys payable in respect of a claim is less
than ten ringgit or a greater prescribed amount of moneys. Subclause
_(2) empowers the Bank to impose a limit on the moneys payable_
in respect of a claim or a description of claims.

_Clause 181 requires the claim to be reduced by any recovery_
from elsewhere.

_Clause 182 enables the Bank to pay to the claimant upfront upon_
assignment of the right to receive dividends from the liquidator in
favour of a fund. This upfront payment to claimants would help to
alleviate their hardship. However, if moneys in an insurance guarantee
scheme fund are insufficient to meet its obligations, the Bank may
pay a claim in instalments or defer payment.

administering or making payment from the funds.
