commencement of this Act.

in the Act, namely the definitions of "appointed date", "Perintah
Majlis Angkatan Tentera" and "Service Chief.

4. Clause 4 seeks to introduce four new sections. Section 5A provides
that the Armed Forces Council may require an officer or serviceman
to serve outside Malaysia. Section 5 B empowers the Armed Forces
Council to attach temporarily any officer or serviceman to any foreign
force in or outside Malaysia whilst section 5c empowers the Armed
Forces Council to second any officer or serviceman to any department
of the Federal Government, a State, local authority, statutory authority
or organisation, in or outside Malaysia. Section 5D seeks to provide
that sections 5A, 5B(l)(b) and 5c shall not apply in relation to the
operational use of the officer or servicemen, as the case may be. This
is in conformity with Article 137(1) of the Federal Constitution.

5. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 6 of the Act to empower the
Armed Forces Council to recognise the reckonable service, if any, of
an officer of the volunteer forces who is commissioned into the regular
forces. Clause 10 seeks to do the same in respect of serviceman.

6. Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 1 0 A to permit an officer
cadet, other than a serviceman who has been appointed as an officer
cadet, to purchase his discharge with the consent of the Armed Forces
Council within three months of his appointment. This is intended to
give newly appointed officer cadets an opportunity to leave the Armed
Forces where he finds it unsuitable for him.

7. Clause 9 seeks to amend section 13 of the Act to extend the
application of that section to the transfer of an officer from one corps
or branch lo another corps or branch in the same Service.

8. Clause 10 seeks to amend section 15 of the Act to allow regulations
made by the Armed Forces Council to provide for matters which may
be issued by Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera. It also seeks to widen
the scope of matters which may be governed by regulations. Clause 16
seeks to do the same in respect of regulations governing servicemen.

of clarity as well as to extend the application of the section to the

10. Clause 13 seeks to introduce two new sections. Section 24A
provides that sections 24, 25 and 26 shall not apply to a person
enlisting in the regular forces on or after the appointed date. Section
24B seeks to provide for the terms of enlistment of servicemen
enlisting on or after the appointed date. Where the person enlisting
has attained the age of eighteen years, the initial enlistment is for
a period of twelve years.

11. Clause 14 seeks to introduce a new section 25A to enable the
service of servicemen enlisting on after the appointed date to be
extended from twelve to fifteen years' of full-time service.

12. Clause 15 seeks to introduce three new sections to the Act.
Sections 26A provides for the re-engagement of servicemen enlisting
on or after the appointed date. Section 26B disallows, the service of
any servicemen to be extended or re-engaged beyond the age of
fifty-five years. Section 26c introduces the requirement for servicemen
who are still serving in the regular forces or the reserve on or after
the appointed date to, upon discharge from full-time service, serve
in the reserve for five years or until the age of fifty years, whichever
is earlier. The Armed Forces Council has the discretion to exempt
any person or category of persons form such reserve service.

13. _Clause 17 seeks to amend section 51 of the Act to enable the_
respective Service Chiefs of each service or any officer authorised by
his Service Chief to make standing orders or other routine orders.

14. _Clause 21 seeks to introduce four new sections 94A, 94B, 94c and_
94D, which are intended to provide for matters including the appointment
of the Chief Provost Marshal, Provost Marshals, provost officers and
investigating officers.

15. _Clause 33 seeks to amend subsection 144(1) of the Act to_
extend the offences exempted from its application to sections 61, 77
and 88. Except for those offences, the three-year limitation period
for a trial by court-martial runs from the date of the commission of
the offence to the date the convening order is issued and served on
the accused person. Further, the clause seeks to provide that in
reckoning this limitation period, the period during which judicial
review proceedings are taken is to be disregarded.

16. _Clauses 35, 37, 40, 44 and 48 seek to introduce similar_
amendments to sections 155, 157, 187, 194 and 206 respectively.

new policy on the creation of a reserve of officers which shall apply

provide that an officer or serviceman serving in the Regular Forces

regular service. For this purpose, subsection 189A(2) provides that the
short service commission officer serving in the Regular Forces shall
be deemed to be a commissioned officer.

every member of a volunteer force who has completed the requisite
training may be required lo continue to serve in the volunteer forces
for a minimum period as prescribed by regulations made under section

Armed Forces Council to apply, mutatis mutandis, certain
provisions of Parts II, III and IV of the Act to the members of the
volunteer forces where it is not inconsistent with the provisions of
Part IX of the Act.

22. Clause 50 seeks to amend section 213 of the Act to enable the
Regular Forces Reserve to use the existing structure and organisation
of the regular forces for the purpose of service offences and punishment.

23. Clause 51 seeks to repeal the Armed Forces (Amendment) Act
1984.

24. Other proposed amendments to the Act not specifically referred
to are consequential in nature necessitated by the change in the
structure of ranks in the Armed Forces as well as the nomenclature of
some ranks.
