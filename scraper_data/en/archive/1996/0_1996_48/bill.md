EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Bill seeks to amend the Offshore Banking Act 1990 (the "Act").

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act by inserting
several new definitions and amending several existing definitions.
The definition of "Bank Negara Malaysia" is necessary because the
definition of "Bank" now no longer refers to Bank Negara but to
the Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority. Definitions such
as "building credit business", "credit token business", "dealing in
securities", "derivative financial instrument", "derivative instrument",
"development finance business", "factoring business", "home monetary
authority", "Islamic banking business", "leasing business", "offshore
bank", "offshore banking business", "offshore investment banking
business" and "securities" have been inserted or amended due to
new provisions being inserted to cover situations in which such
terms are used.

3. At the moment section 4 of the Act prohibits any person from
carrying on offshore banking business (which includes investment
banking business) without a valid licence. Clause 3 seeks to amend
section 4 to enable a licence to be granted for persons who are
desirous of carrying on investment banking business only.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 5 of the Act to clarify—_

_(a) in paragraph (2)(ee) that an application for an offshore_
banking licence by a foreign offshore company needs only
to be supported by an undertaking;

_(b) in subparagraph (2)(ee)(ii) that a foreign offshore company_
who appplies for an offshore banking licence needs only
to notify the Bank of any change in the percentage of
participation of its participants.

5. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 17—

_(a) to require a licensed offshore bank to submit four copies_
of its audited annual financial reports instead of two as
is the present requirement; and


-----

_Offshore Banking (Amendment)_ 11

_(b) to delete subsection (2) as the submission of annual financial_
reports approved by participants of a licensed offshore
bank is not required by the Bank.

6. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 18—_

_(a) in subsection (1), to provide for a greater flow of_
information, at such frequency specified by the Bank, from
licensed offshore banks to the Bank; and

_(b) in subsection (3), to allow the Bank to disclose any_
information which it obtains from a licensed offshore bank
to the relevant home monetary authority of the licensed
offshore bank.

7. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 23 to allow the Bank to require
the internal auditors or approved auditors of a licensed offshore
bank which is a foreign offshore company to verify submissions
made by the licensed offshore bank,

8. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 26 to extend the scope of_
indemnity provided in that section to the Director General and members
of the Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority.

9. Clause 10 seeks to introduce three new sections, namely, sections
33, 34 and 35.

Section 33 confers the status of exempt dealer on licensed offshore
banks and provides that a representative of a licensed offshore bank
dealing in securities need not be licensed as a dealer's representative.

Section 34 provides that the provisions of the Securities Industry
Act 1983 shall not apply to transactions carried out by licensed
offshore banks in certain circumstances.

Finally, section 36 provides for the internal audit and appointment
of internal auditors of a licensed offshore bank.

10. Other amendments not specifically mentioned in this Statement
are consequential and minor in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
