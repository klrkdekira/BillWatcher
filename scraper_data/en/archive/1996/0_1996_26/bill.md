## disposition took place, render the settlor,
insolvent or without property by which that
## creditor's claim, if successful, could have been
satisfied,

be void or voidable and the offshore trust shall be liable
to satisfy the creditor's claim out of the property which
but for the creation, registration or disposition would
have been available to satisfy the creditor's claim and
## such liability shall only be to the extent of the interest that the settlor had in the property prior to the creation, registration or disposition, and any accumulation to the property, if any, subsequent thereto.

be satisfied, regard shall be had to the fair market value
of the settlor's property (not being property of or relating
to the trust), at the time immediately after such creation,
registration or disposition, and in the event that the fair
market value of such property exceeded the value of the
creditor's claim, at that time, after the creation, registration

accrued or had arisen.


(5) A settlor shall not have imputed to him an intent

to defraud a creditor solely by reason that the settlor—
