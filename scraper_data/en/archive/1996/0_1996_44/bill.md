a complaint of an offence of which he is authorized to
take cognizance he may, when the complainant has been
examined, record his reason for doubting the truth of the
complaint and may then postpone the issue of process

a Religious Enforcement Officer to make inquiries for
the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the
complaint and report to him the result of such inquiries.

**76. (1) The Judge before whom a complaint is made**
may dismiss the complaint if, after examining the

his reasons for so doing.

an offence there is sufficient ground for proceeding,

OF THE CHARGE

with which the accused is charged.

(2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any
specific name, the offence may be described in the charge
by that name only.

(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give
it any specific name, so much of the definition of the
offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of
the matter with which he is charged.

(4) The law and provisions of the law against which
the offence is said to have been committed shall be
mentioned in the charge.

(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to

a statement that every legal condition required by law
to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the
particular case.

**79. The charge shall contain such particulars as to the**
time and place of the alleged offence and the person, if
any, against whom or the thing, if any, in respect of
which it was committed as are reasonably sufficient to
give the accused notice of the matter with which he is

charged.

**80. When the nature of the case is such that the particulars**
mentioned in sections 78 and 79 do not give the accused
sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged,
the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner
in which the alleged offence was committed as will be
sufficient for that purpose.

**81. In every charge, the words used in describing an**
offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sense
attached to them respectively by the law under which
such offence is punishable.

**82. No error in stating either the offence or the particulars**
required to be stated in the charge, and no omission to
state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded,

any time before judgment is pronounced.

(2) Every such amendment or addition shall be read

(2) If the accused declares that he is not ready, the
Court shall duly consider the reasons he may give and
if proceeding immediately with the trial is, in the opinion
of the Court, not likely to prejudice the accused in his
defence or the Prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the
Court may, in its discretion, after such amendment or
addition has been framed or made, proceed with the trial
as if the amended or added charge had been the original
charge.

**85. If the amended or added charge is such that proceeding**
immediately with the trial is likely, in the opinion of the
Court, to prejudice the accused or the Prosecutor, as
mentioned in section 84, the Court may either direct a
new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be
necessary.

**86. If the offence stated in the amended or added charge**
is one for the prosecution of which previous sanction is
necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such
sanction is obtained, unless sanction has been already
obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on
which the amended or added charged is founded.

**87. Whenever a charge is amended or added by the**
Court after the commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor

exceeding three.

**90. (1) If the offences are a series of acts so connected**
together as to form the same transaction, the person accused
of them may be charged with and tried at one trial for
every such offence.

(2) If the acts alleged constitute offences falling within

two or more separate definitions of offences, the person
accused of them may be charged with and tried at one

trial for each of such offences.

(3) If several acts, of which one or more than one

would by itself or themselves constitute an offence,
constitute when combined a different offence, the person
accused of them may be charged with and tried at one
trial for the offence constituted by such acts when combined,
or for any offence constituted by any one or more of such
acts.

**91. If a single act or series of acts is of such a nature**
that it is doubtful which of the several offences the facts
which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be
charged with having committed all or any of such offences,
and any number of such charges may be tried at once,

or he may be charged in the alternative with having
committed any one of such offences and may be tried at
once.

**92. If, in the case mentioned in section 91, the accused**
is charged with one offence and it appears in evidence
that he committed a different offence for which he might
have been charged, he may be convicted of the offence
which he is proven to have committed although he was
not charged with it.

offence, although the attempt is not separately charged.

**94. ( 1 ) When a person is charged with an offence**
consisting of several particulars, a combination of some
only of which constitutes a lesser offence, and such
combination is proved but the remaining particulars are
not proved, he may be convicted of the lesser offence
though he was not charged with it.

(2) When a person is charged with an offence and
facts are proved which reduce it to a lesser offence, he
may be convicted of the lesser offence although he is not
charged with it.

**95. When more than one person are accused of the same**
offence or of different offences committed in the same
transaction, or when one person is accused of committing
an offence and another of abetment of or attempt to
commit the same offence, they may be charged and tried
together or separately as the Court thinks fit.

CHAPTER 4

OF TRIALS

**96. The following procedure shall be observed by Judges**
in trials:

_(a) when the accused appears or is brought before_

be asked whether he is guilty of the offence
charged or claims to be tried;

_(b) if the accused pleads guilty to a charge, whether_
as originally framed or as amended, the plea
shall be recorded and he may be convicted

understands the nature and consequences of his
plea and intends to admit, without qualification,
the offence alleged against him;

or claims trial, the Court shall proceed to hear
the complainant, if any, and to take all such
evidence as may be produced in support of the
prosecution;

_(d) when the Court thinks it necessary it shall obtain_
from the complainant or otherwise the names of

facts of the case and to be able to give evidence
for the prosecution, and shall summon to give
evidence before itself such of them as it thinks
## necessary;

_(e) the accused or his Peguam Syarie shall be allowed_
to cross-examine all the witnesses for the
prosecution through the Judge;

against the accused has been made out which
if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, the
Court shall record an order of acquittal;

_(g) nothing in paragraph (f) shall be deemed to_
prevent the Court from discharging the accused
at any previous stage of the case if for reasons
to be recorded by the Court it considers the
charge to be groundless;

_(h) if, when such evidence has been taken, the Court_
is of the opinion that there are grounds for
## presuming that the accused has committed the
offence charged or some other offence which

opinion it ought to try, it shall consider the
charge recorded against the accused and decide
whether it is sufficient and, if necessary, shall
## amend the charge;

as amended and he shall be again asked whether
he is guilty or has any defence to make;

such ground shall be recorded by it in writing;

_(m)_ (i) if the Court finds the accused not guilty,

the Court shall record an order of acquittal;

(ii) if the Court finds the accused guilty or if

(2) When any person is charged before the Court with

an offence punishable by such Court, and the Court finds
that the charge is proved, but is of the opinion that having
regard to the character, antecedents, age, health or mental
condition of the person charged, or to the trivial nature
of the offence, or to the extenuating circumstances under
which the offence was committed, it is inexpedient to
inflict any punishment other than a nominal punishment

make an order—

_(a) dismissing the charge or complaint after such_

admonition or caution to the offender as to the
Court seems fit;

_(b) order the offender to be detained in a welfare_

during such period.

(3) The Court may, in addition to any such order,

or for loss, not exceeding the sum of one thousand ringgit,
or to pay such costs of the proceedings as the Court
thinks reasonable or to pay both compensation and costs.

(4) If the Court is satisfied by information on oath that

the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions
of his bond, it may issue a warrant for his apprehension.

(5) Any offender when apprehended on any such warrant

shall, if not forthwith brought before the Court having

on his behalf, may sum up his case;

_(c) the officer conducting the prosecution shall have_

the right of reply on the whole case when the

the complaint or charge was made to pay to the accused,
or to each or any of the accused where there are more

than one, such compensation, not exceeding one thousand

subsequent offence, he shall then be asked
whether he has been previously convicted as
alleged in the charge;

time when he was convicted.

(4) A person acquitted or convicted of any offence
constituted by any acts may, notwithstanding such acquittal
or conviction, be subsequently charged with and tried for
any other offence constituted by the same acts which he
may have committed, if the Court by which he was first
tried was not competent to try the offence with which
he is subsequently charged.

(5) The dismissal of a complaint, or the discharge of
the accused, is not an acquittal for the purposes of this
section.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO EVIDENCE

**192. (1) Whenever it appears to a Judge that any person**
able to give material evidence either for the prosecution
or defence in relation to a seizable offence, is so dangerously
ill that it is not practicable to take his evidence according

deposition of such person provided such reasonable notice
as the case admits has been given to the Prosecutor and
the accused of the intention to take it and of the time
and place at which the Judge intends to take it.

the officer in charge of the prison to convey him to the
place at the time notified and that officer shall convey
him accordingly.

any offence to which such deposition relates that the
deponent is dead or that for any sufficient cause his
attendance cannot be procured, the deposition may be
read either for or against the accused, notwithstanding
his absence when it was taken, if it is certified under
the hand of the Judge who took it and the contrary is
not proved, or if it is shown by extrinsic evidence that
the deponent was at the time of his examination dangerously
ill as mentioned in subsection (1) and that the deposition
was duly taken at the place and time notified and that
reasonable notice of the intention to take it was given
to the person against whom it is tendered in evidence,
so that he or his Peguam Syarie might have been present
and might have had, if he had chosen to be present, full
opportunity of cross-examination.

**193. Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of a Judge**
that any witness bound to give evidence upon the trial
of any seizable offence intends to leave Malaysia and

maintenance and for compensating him for his detention

identity of the accused person with the person so convicted
or acquitted.

(2) In case the officer in charge of any prison shall
state in any certificate signed by him that the finger
prints which appear on such certificate are those of the
persons to whom the certificate relates, such certificate
shall be evidence of the fact so stated.

document purporting to be a certificate of conviction and
