EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Broadcasting Act 1988 ("the Act").

2. _Clause 1 deals with the short title and commencement of this_
Bill.

in the Act and introduce new definitions into the Act to, amongst
others, cater for new technologies in broadcasting and facilitate
enforcement of the Act.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend subsection 4(1) of the Act to require_
the licensing of both the activity of broadcasting any broadcast
matter in or from Malaysia and specifying the broadcasting services,
as listed out in a new Schedule sought to be introduced through

is given to the Minister to amend the Schedule, by order published
in the Gazette, in a new subsection (5) introduced into section 4
of the Act.

contravention of the conditions of a licence to broadcast an
offence.

8. Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new section 11 A in a new Part
IIIA to require that a licence is to be obtained before a person may
receive in Malaysia any foreign broadcast matter from any satellite
or transmit from Malaysia any broadcast matter to any satellite.

9. The words "memasang" and "dipasang"' in the national language
text of the Act are replaced with the words "menempatkan" and
"ditempatkan" respectively in clauses 10, 11, 12 and 23 to reflect
the equivalent meaning of the word "install" within the context of
