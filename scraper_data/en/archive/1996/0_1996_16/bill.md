20 BILL

3. Clause 2 seeks to introduce certain new definitions for terms
used in the Act, namely the definition of "appointed date", "Perintah
Majlis Angkatan Tentera" and "Service Chief.

4. Clause 4 seeks to introduce four new sections. Section 5A
provides that the Armed Forces Council may require an officer
or serviceman to serve outside Malaysia. Section 5 B empowers
the Armed Forces Council to attach temporarily any officer or
serviceman to any foreign force in or outside Malaysia. Section
5c empowers the Armed Forces Council to second any officer
or serviceman to any department of the Federal Government, a
State, local authority, statutory authority or organisation, in or
outside Malaysia. Section 5D seeks to provide that sections 5A,
5 B and 5c shall not apply to the operational use of the officer
or servicemen. This is in conformity with Article 137(1)
of the Federal Constitution.

5. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 6 of the Act to empower the
Armed Forces Council to recognise the reckonable service, if any,
of an officer of the volunteer forces who is commissioned into the
regular forces. Clause 11 seeks to do the same in respect of a
serviceman.

6. Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 10A to permit an officer
cadet, other than a serviceman who has been appointed as an officer
cadet, to purchase his discharge with the consent of the Armed
Forces Council within three months of his appointment. This is
intended to give newly appointed officer cadets an opportunity to
leave the armed forces where he finds it unsuitable for him.

_7. Clause 9 seeks to amend section 13 of the Act to extend the_
application of that section to the transfer of an officer from one
corps or branch to another corps or branch in the same Service.

8. Clause 10 seeks to amend section 15 of the Act to allow
regulations made by the Armed Forces Council to provide for matters
which may be issued by Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera. It also
seeks to widen the scope of matters which may be governed by
regulations. Clause 16 seeks to do the same in respect of regulations
governing servicemen.

9. Clause 12 seeks to amend section 21 of the Act for the purposes
of clarity as well as to extend the application of the section to the
Navy and the Air Force.

10. Clause 13 seeks to introduce two new sections, Section 24A
provides that sections 24, 25 and 26 shall not apply to a person
enlisting in the regular forces on or after the appointed date. Section
24B seeks to provide for the terms of enlistment of servicemen
enlisting on or after the appointed date. Where the person enlisting
has attained the age of eighteen years, the initial enlistment is for
twelve years.

ARMED FORCES (AMENDMENT) 21

11. Clause 14 seeks to introduce a new section 25 A to enable the
service of servicemen enlisting on or after the appointed date to be
extended from twelve to fifteen years of full-time service.

12. Clause 15 seeks to introduce three new sections. Section 26A
provides for the re-engagement of servicemen enlisting on or after
the appointed date. Section 26B disallows the service of any servicemen
to be extended or re-engaged beyond the age of fifty-five years.
Section 26c introduces the requirement for servicemen who are still
serving in the regular forces or the reserve on or after the appointed
date to, upon discharge from full-time service or completion of
service in the reserve, serve in the reserve for five years or until the
age of fifty years, whichever is earlier. The Armed Forces Council
has the discretion to exempt any person or category of persons from
such service in the reserve.

13. _Clause 17 seeks to amend section 51 of the Act to enable the_
'respective Service Chiefs of each Service or any officer authorised
by his Service Chief to make standing orders or other routine orders.

14. _Clause 21 seeks to introduce four new sections. Sections_
94A, 94B, 94c and 94D are intended to provide for matters including
the appointment of the Chief Provost Marshal, Provost Marshals,
provost officers and investigating officers.

15. _Clause 33 seeks to amend subsection 144(1) of the Act to_
extend the offences exempted from its application to sections 61,17
and 88. Except for those offences, the three-year limitation period
for a trial by court-martial runs from the date of the commission of
the offence to the date the convening order is issued and served on
the accused person. Further, the clause seeks to provide that in
reckoning this limitation period, the period during which judicial
review proceedings are taken is to be disregarded.

16. _Clauses 35, 37, 40, 44_ and 48 seek to introduce similar
amendments to sections 155, 157, 187, 194 and 206 respectively.
The amendments are intended to allow regulations made by the
Armed Forces Council to provide for matters which may be issued
by Perintah Majlis Angkatan Tentera.

17. Clause 41 seeks to introduce two new sections. Section 187A
authorises the collection of contributions for the welfare and benefit
of the armed forces and their families. Section 187B validates the
collection made prior to the coming into force of this Act and the
use thereof.

18. _Clause 42 seeks to amend section 188 of the Act to introduce_
the new policy on the creation of a reserve of officers which shall
apply to all officers who on or after the appointed date, are still
serving in the regular forces.


-----

22 BILL

19. Clause 43 seeks to introduce a new section 189A to provide
that an officer or serviceman serving in the Regular Forces Reserve
shall hold the last substantive rank held by him whilst in the regular
service. For this purpose, subsection 189A(2) provides that the short
service commission officer serving in the regular forces shall be
deemed to be a commissioned officer.

20. _Clause 46 seeks to amend section 201 of the Act to provide_
that every member of a volunteer force who has completed the
requisite training may be required to continue to serve in the volunteer
forces for a minimum period as prescribed by regulations made
under section 207 of the Act. Clause 49 in turn amends subsection
207(2) of the Act to provide for this prescription of a minimum
period.

21. Clause 47 seeks to introduce a new section 201A to permit the
Armed Forces Council to apply, mutatis mutandis, certain provisions
of Parts II, III and IV of the Act to the members of the volunteer
forces where it is not inconsistent with the provisions of Part IX of
the Act.

22. Clause 50 seeks to amend section 213 of the Act to enable the
Regular Forces Reserve to use the existing structure and organisation
of the regular forces for the purpose of service offences and punishment.

23. Clause 51 seeks to repeal the Armed Forces (Amendment) Act
1984.

24. Other proposed amendments to the Act not specifically referred
to are consequential in nature necessitated by the change in the
structure of ranks in the Armed Forces as well as the nomenclature
of some ranks.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure
the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN. (U[2]) 1430.]
