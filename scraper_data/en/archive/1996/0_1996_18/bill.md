EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Road Transport Act 1987 (the "Act").

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 to amend the definition of_
"driving licence" and to introduce the definitions of "learner's driving
licence", "licensed registrar" and "probationary driving licence".

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 8 to provide for the imposition
of a duty upon a licensed registrar to keep and maintain the register
of all motor vehicles registered under the Act after the privatisation
of the activity in respect of registration and licensing of motor
vehicles. Various amendments have also been made under clauses
_4, 5, 6(a)(i), 8, 9. 10, 11, 12(a), 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 34, 35(a), 36,_
_37 and 39 as a result of privatisation._

4. Subclause 6(a)(iii) seeks to amend section 11 by deleting the
proviso to subsection (1) as the proviso will no longer be applicable
after the introduction of new subsections (1A) and (1B) into subclause
_6(b) which allow, inter alia, an owner of a motor vehicle to assign_
his registration number to another motor vehicle owned by another
person.

5. Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 11 A to allow any
person to propose his own registration number.

6. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 27 to extend the types of_
offences where the penalty is a disqualification from obtaining a
driving licence for a period of twelve months.

7. Clause 19 seeks to amend section 29 to introduce a new category
of driving licence, namely a probationary driving licence. Under
this provision, a driver who has just passed the prescribed tests will
be granted a probationary driving licence for a period of two years
before a competent driving licence is granted to him. Clause 19
also seeks to provide that the driving licence of a person will not
be renewed if the person has an outstanding matter or case.

8. _Clause 20 seeks to amend section 35 to empower the Director_
General of the Road Transport Department to revoke a driving licence
under the demerit point system.


-----

ROAD TRANSPORT (AMENDMENT) 17

9. Clause 21 seeks to introduce a new section 35A to empower
the Director General of the Road Transport Department to revoke
a probationary driving licence.

10. _Clauses 22 and 23 seek to amend sections 37 and 38 to extend_
the power of the Director General of the Road Transport Department
to revoke a driving licence of a person as a consequence of the
introduction of section 35A.

11. Clause 24 seeks to introduce a new subsection (3A) into section
41 to empower the court to revoke a probationary driving licence
of a person. Similar amendments are also proposed in clauses 25,
_26, 27, 28, 29 and 31(b) to sections 42, 43, 44, 45, 45A and 45B._

12. _Clauses 30 and 31(a) seek to amend sections 45B and 45c to_
enable the same penalty as in the existing section 45A to be
imposed on any person who refuses to undergo a breath test.

13. _Clause 32 seeks to amend subsection 45G(l) to amend the_
definition of "breath test".

14. _Clause 33 seeks to amend section 54 to extend the provision_
of that section to offences committed under sections 45A to 45c.

15. Clause 38 seeks to introduce a new section 117A to enable
a record of previous conviction to be admissible as evidence and
to constitute prima facie proof of any fact stated therein.

16. _Clause 40 seeks to amend section 126 by introducing a new_
subsection (8) to empower the Minister to direct the Director General
or a Director to exercise any function of a road transport officer
that has been assigned to any person licensed under that section.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
