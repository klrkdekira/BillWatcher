EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Valuers, Appraisers and Estate Agents
Act 1981 ("the Act").

2. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act to substitute_
certain definitions and to introduce certain new definitions for
expressions used in the Act.

3. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4 of the Act to clarify the duties_
and functions of the Director General.

4. Clauses 5 and 6 seek to amend subsections 5(2) and 6(3) of the
Act respectively to increase the penalties in those provisions from
a fine not exceeding five thousand ringgit to a fine not exceeding
ten thousand ringgit.

5. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 9 of the Act to reconstitute the_
Board of Valuers, Appraisers and Estate Agents by substituting for
the member nominated by the Board of Surveyors three registered
valuers nominated by the President of the Board.

6. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 10 of the Act to clarify the_
functions of the Board. It also seeks to add two new functions,
namely, the appointment of members of the Board to sit on any
board, committee or body formed for any purpose relating to the
profession or to any related profession and the borrowing or raising
of money for the purchase or lease of immovable property required
by the Board as well as the disposal of such property.

7. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 12 of the Act to provide that_
the fines and costs payable under the Act are to be credited to the

apply to the Board for an authority to practise.

10. Clause 13 seeks to amend section 16 of the Act to clarify the

the Register of Valuers, Appraisers and Estate Agents if the Board
considers him fit to practise estate agency.

the President-of the Board to prepare, within three months of the
