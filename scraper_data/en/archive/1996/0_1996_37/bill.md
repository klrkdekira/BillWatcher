(18) provides that if the Council finds that no case has been made
against a member, he shall be reinstated. Subsection (19) provides
that the member shall hold office for the unexpired term of his
office if the reinstatement is before the expiration of his term of
office.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend subsection 17(1) of the Act by_
introducing a new restriction on registration under the Act. The
Council may direct the Registrar not to register any person who is

the general penalty provided in that subsection.

7. _Clause 8 seeks to amend subparagraph 2(3) of the First Schedule_
