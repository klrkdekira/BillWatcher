which are protectable as copyright and those which are not. The
Government has also decided to expand the power of the Copyright
Tribunal to facilitate arbitration of disputes on matters relating to
licences and licensing schemes. Clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
seek to amend the Act towards these ends.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 3 of the Act by redefining
"artistic work" to exclude three-dimensional works of paintings,
drawings, etchings, lithographs, woodcuts, engravings and prints
and three-dimensional works related to geography, topography,
architecture and science.

4. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 7 of the Act to provide that
there should be no copyright protection for works already registered
under the legislation enforced in Malaysia relating to industrial
design. It also seeks to provide that copyright protection ceases
after the article to which a protected design has been applied has
been reproduced more than fifty times by an industrial process.

5. Clause 4 seeks to introduce new sections 13A, 13B and 13c. These
new sections seek firstly to provide that industrial design protection
based on copyright drawings alone is no longer possible, that although
drawings continue to be artistic works and can be infringed by both
two-dimensional and three-dimensional copies, whether direct or
indirect, such protection is not available for any design document
or model recording or embodying a design "where an article is made
to the design unless that article itself is an artistic work or a typeface.
Secondly, these new sections seek to provide that where an artistic
work has been industrially exploited, by or with the licence of the
copyright owner, the period of copyright protection for such purposes
will now be limited to 25 years from the end of the calendar year
in which such articles are first marketed. Thirdly, these new sections
seek to provide that the copyright in an artistic work is not infringed
by anything done in pursuance of an assignment or licence made
or granted by a person registered under the Registered Designs Act
1949 of the United Kingdom or similar legislation enforced in Malaysia
at the material time.

6. Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new Part IVA relating to
copyright licensing. The new Part IVA deals with instances when
the aggrieved party may make references or applications to the
Copyright Tribunal with respect to licensing schemes, entitlement
to licences and proposed or expiring licences granted by licensing
bodies.

The new section 27A provides for the types of licensing schemes
which may be referred to the Copyright Tribunal.

22 BILL

The new sections 27B, 27c and 27D specify the instances
whereby proposed and existing licensing schemes as well as a further
reference of licensing schemes may be referred to the Copyright
Tribunal by users or organizations representative of users or the
operator of the licensing scheme.

The new sections 27E and 27F specify the instances and the party
or parties who may refer or apply to the Copyright Tribunal with
respect to the entitlement to a licence under a licensing scheme.

The new section 27G provides that a proposed scheme shall be
in force and an existing scheme shall remain in operation so long
as the order of the Copyright Tribunal remains in force. It also
empowers the Copyright Tribunal to backdate its order with regard
to the charges payable.

The new section 27H provides for the types of licences that may
be granted by licensing bodies otherwise than in pursuance of a
licensing scheme.

The new sections 27I and 27J specify the instances where the
terms of a proposed licence and a licence which is due to expire
may be referred to the Copyright Tribunal by the prospective licensee
and licensee respectively, and the new section 27K allows
applications to be made to the Copyright Tribunal for review of its
orders.

The new section 27L provides that while the order of the
Copyright Tribunal is in force, the applicant who complies with the
order is deemed to be in the same position as regards infringement
of copyright as if he had at all material times been the holder of
a licence granted by the owner of the copyright in question on the
terms specified in the order. Consequently, the benefit of the order
may be assigned unless'the assignment is expressly prohibited under
the terms of the Copyright Tribunal's order.

7. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 29 of the Act to provide for
the appointment of a Deputy Chairman of the Copyright Tribunal
by the Minister. It also seeks to provide for the appointment of a
Secretary to the Tribunal and such other officers as may be necessary
by the Minister to assist the Copyright Tribunal in view of the
increased jurisdiction of the Copyright Tribunal relating to disputes
in copyright licensing.

8. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 30 of the Act to provide that
the chairman of the proceedings shall have a further casting vote
if the votes are equal in making a decision during any proceedings.
It also makes it clear that the Copyright Tribunal shall be deemed
to be duly constituted throughout the proceeding if any member is
unable to continue in the midst of the proceeding so long as the
quorum is not reduced to less than two.

9. Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section 30A which provides
that only questions of law arising in proceedings concluded before
the Copyright Tribunal may be referred to the High Court either
by the Copyright Tribunal on its own motion or at the request of
any party which referred the dispute to the Copyright Tribunal.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to delete section 32 of the Act in view of the_
provision under the new section 30A which provides for only questions
of law to be referred to the High Court.

11. Clause 10 seeks to introduce a new section 41A which
provides that the Controller or a Deputy Controller may compound
any offence under the Act or subsidiary legislation made thereunder.

12. Clause 11 seeks to delete section 58 of the Act since the new
Part IVA provides for the aggrieved party to refer disputes on matters
relating to licences and licensing schemes to the Copyright Tribunal
instead of the High Court.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN.(U[2]) 1503.]
