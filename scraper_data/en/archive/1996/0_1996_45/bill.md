CHAPTER 1

BURDEN OF PROOF

**72. The burden to produce evidence in a civil case lies**

a fact (al Mudda'a 'alaih).

**73. (1) Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as**
to any legal right or liability which is dependent on the
existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those
facts exist.

(2) When a person is bound to prove the existence of

any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that
person.

_ILLUSTRATION_

_A desires a Court to give judgment that B shall be punished_

for a crime which A says B has committed.

which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being
had to the common course of natural events, human
conduct, and public and private business, in their relation

_Explanation—A witness may give oral evidence of statements_
made by other persons about the contents of documents if the
statements are in themselves relevant facts.

_ILLUSTRATION_

The question is whether A assaulted B.

_C deposes that he heard A. say to D: "B wrote a letter_
accusing me of theft and I will be revenged on him.".
The statement is relevant as showing A 's motive for the
assault and evidence may be given of it though no other
evidence is given about the letter.

**99. (1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous**
statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing,
and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding
in which he is cross-examined, without the writing being
shown to him or being proved; but if it is intended to
contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before
the writing can be proved, be called to those parts of
it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting
him.

(2) If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a previous
oral statement made by him relevant to matters in question
in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined
and inconsistent with his present testimony, does not
distinctly admit that he made such statement, proof may
be given that he did in fact make it; but before proof
can be given, the circumstances of the supposed statement,
sufficient to designate the particular occasion, shall be
mentioned to the witness, and he shall be asked whether
or not he made such statement.

**100. When a witness may be cross-examined he may,**
in addition to the questions hereinbefore referred to, be
asked any question which tends—

_(a) to test his accuracy, veracity or credibility;_

_(b) to discover who he is and what is his position_
in life; or

_(c) to shake his credit by injuring his character,_

although the answer to such questions might
tend directly or indirectly to criminate him, or
might expose or tend directly or indirectly to
expose him to a penalty or forfeiture.

**101. (1) If any question relates to a matter not relevant**
to the suit or proceeding, except so far as it affects the
credit of the witness by injuring his character, the Court

shall decide whether or not the witness shall be compelled
to answer it, and may, if it does not think fit to compel
him to answer the question, warn the witness that he is
not obliged to answer it.

(2) In exercising its discretion, the Court shall have

regard to the following considerations:

_(a) the questions are proper if they are of such a_

nature that the truth of the imputation conveyed
by them would seriously affect the opinion of
the Court as to the credibility of the witness
on the matter to which he testifies;

_(b) the questions are improper if the imputation_

which they convey relates to matters so remote
in time or of such a character that the truth of
the imputation would not affect or would affect
in a slight degree the opinion of the Court as
to the credibility of the witness on the matter
to which he testifies;

_(c) the questions are improper if there is a great_

disproportion between the importance of the
imputation made against the witness's character
and the importance of his evidence;

_(d) the Court may, if it sees fit, draw from the_

witness's refusal to answer, the inference that
the answer, if given, would be unfavourable.

**102. No such question as is referred to in section 101**
shall be asked unless the person asking it has reasonable
grounds for thinking that the imputation which it conveys
is well founded.

_(a) A Peguam Syarie is instructed by another Peguam_
_Syarie or reliable source that an important witness is a_
professional gambler. This is a reasonable ground for
asking the witness whether he is a professional gambler.

_(b) A Peguam Syarie is informed by a person in Court_
that an important witness is a professional gambler. The
informant, on being questioned by the Peguam Syarie,
gives satisfactory reasons for his statement. This is a
reasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is
a professional gambler.

_(c)_ A witness of whom nothing whatever is known is

asked at random whether he is a professional gambler.
There are here no reasonable grounds for the question.

_(d) A witness of whom nothing whatever is known, being_
questioned as to his mode of life and means of living,
gives unsatisfactory answers. This may be a reasonable
ground for asking him if he is a professional gambler.

**103. If the Court is of the opinion that any such question**
as is referred to in section 101 was asked without
reasonable grounds, it may, if it was asked by a Peguam
_Syarie, report the circumstances of the case to the Majlis_
Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan or other authority to
which the Peguam Syarie is subject in the exercise of

_(Federal_ _Territories)_

**106. When a witness has been asked and has answered**
any question which is relevant to the inquiry only so far
as it tends to shake his credit by injuring his character,
no evidence shall be given to contradict him; but if he
answers falsely he may afterwards be charged with giving
false evidence.

_Exception I—If a witness is asked whether he has been_

previously convicted of any crime and denies it, evidence
may be given of his previous conviction.

_Exception 2—If a witness is asked any question tending to_

impeach his impartiality and answers it by denying the facts
suggested, he may be contradicted.

_ILLUSTRATIONS_

_(a) A witness is asked whether he was not dismissed_
from a situation for dishonesty. He denies it.

Evidence is offered to show that he was dismissed

for dishonesty

The evidence is not admissible.

_(b) A affirms that on a certain day he saw B at Malacca. A_
is asked whether he himself was not on that day at Penang.
He denies it.

Evidence is offered to show that A was on that day at

Penang.


Exclusion of

Question by
parly to his
own witness.


The evidence is admissible, not as contradicting A on

a fact which affects his credit, but as contradicting the
alleged fact that B was seen on the day in question in
Malacca.

_(c) A is asked whether he has not said that he would be_
revenged on 8, against whom he gives evidence. He denies
it.

He may be contradicted on the ground that the question

tends to impeach his impartiality.

**107. The Court may, in its discretion, permit the person**
who calls a witness to put any questions to him which
might be put in cross-examination by the adverse party.


-----

# 56 Bill

**108. The credit of a witness may be impeached in the**
following ways by the adverse party or, with the consent
of the Court, by the party who calls him:

_(a) by the evidence of persons who testify that they_
from their knowledge of the witness believe him
to be unworthy of credit;

_(b) by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has_
accepted the offer of a bribe, or has received any
other corrupt inducement to give his evidence;

_(c) by proof of former statements inconsistent with_
any part of his evidence which is liable to be
contradicted.

_Explanation—A witness declaring another witness to be unworthy_
of credit may not, upon his examination-in-chief, give reasons for
his belief, but he may be asked his reasons in cross-examination,
and the answers which he gives shall not be contradicted, though,
if they are false, he may afterwards be charged with giving false
evidence.

**109. When a witness whom it is intended to corroborate**
gives evidence of any relevant fact, he may be questioned
as to any other circumstances which he observed at or near
to the time or place at which the relevant fact occurred, if
the Court is of the opinion that the circumstances, if
proved, would corroborate the testimony of the witness as
to the relevant fact to which he testifies.

_ILLUSTRATION_

_A, an accomplice, gives an account of an offence in which_
he took part. He describes various incidents, unconnected
with the offence, which occurred on his way to and from
the place where it was committed.

Independent evidence of these facts may be given in order
to corroborate his evidence as to the offence itself.

**110. In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness,**
any former statement made by him whether written or
verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the
same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or
before any authority legally competent to investigate the
fact, may be proved.

**111. Whenever any statement declared to be qarinah**
under section 20 or 21 is proved, all matters may be proved
either in order to contradict or to corroborate it, or in order
to impeach or confirm the credit of the person by whom it
was made, which might have been proved if that person
# had been called as a witness and had denied upon crossexamination the truth of the matter suggested.

**112. (1) A witness may while under examination refresh**

his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at
the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned,
or so soon afterwards that the Court considers it likely that

(2) The witness may also refer to any such writing

made by any other person and read by the witness within
the time aforesaid, if when he read it, he knew it to be
correct.

(3) Whenever the witness may refresh his memory by

reference to any document, he may, with the permission
of the Court, refer to a copy of that document:

reason for the non-production of the original.

(4) An expert may refresh his memory by reference

to professional treatises.

**113. A witness may also testify to facts mentioned in**
any such document as is mentioned in section 112 although
he has no specific recollection of the facts themselves,
if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the
document.

_ILLUSTRATION_

A book-keeper may testify to facts recorded by him in
books regularly kept in the course of business if he knows
that the books were correctly kept, although he has
forgotten the particular transactions entered.

requires it; such party may, if he pleases, cross-examine
the witness thereupon.

**115. (1) A witness summoned to produce a document**

shall, if it is in his possession or power, bring it to Court
notwithstanding any objection which there may be to its
production or to its admissibility. The validity of any
such objection shall be decided on by the Court.

(2) The Court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document

unless it refers to affairs of State, or take other evidence
to enable it to determine on its admissibility.

(3) If for such a purpose it is necessary to cause any

document to be translated, the Court may, if it thinks
fit, direct the translator to keep the contents secret unless
the document is to be given in evidence.

**116. When a party calls for a document which he has**
given the other party notice to produce, and the document
is produced and inspected by the party calling for its
production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the
party producing it requires him to do so and if it is
relevant.

**117. When a party refuses to produce a document which**

he has had notice to produce, he may not afterwards use
the document as evidence without the consent of the
other party or the order of the Court.

_ILLUSTRATION_

_A sues B on an agreement, and gives B notice to produce_

it. At the trial A calls for the document, and B refuses
to produce it. A gives secondary evidence of its contents.
_B seeks to produce the document itself to contradict the_

secondary evidence given by A, or in order to show that
the agreement is not stamped. He may not do so.
