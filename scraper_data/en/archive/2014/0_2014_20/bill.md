EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Malaysian Airline System Berhad (Administration) Bill 2014 (“the proposed
Act”) seeks to provide for the administration of the Malaysian Airline System
Berhad (“MAS”), its wholly owned subsidiary companies and partially owned
subsidiary companies providing goods or carrying out services or both that
are essential to the operations of MAS and to provide for the establishment
of a new entity known as Malaysia Airlines Berhad which will replace MAS
as the national carrier; and to provide for related matters.

2. Part I of the proposed Act deals with preliminary matters.

_Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act and seeks to empower_

the Minister to appoint a date for the commencement of the proposed Act.

_Clause 2 provides that the application of the proposed Act is limited to_

a period of 5 years from the date of the coming into operation of proposed
Act or upon the listing of the Malaysia Airlines Berhad on the official list
of Bursa Malaysia Berhad, whichever is earlier. This is in line with the
objective of the proposed Act to provide provisional measures to ensure that
the essential air services and connectivity to and from and within Malaysia
by MAS as the national carrier are uninterrupted. Clause 2 also empowers the


-----

_Malaysian Airline System Berhad (Administration)_ 33

Minister to declare, by order published in the _Gazette, an earlier cessation of_
the proposed Act if the objectives of the proposed Act are earlier achieved. If
circumstances warrant, the application of the proposed Act may be extended
by a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament, for a further period as
may be specified in the resolution.

_Clause 3 contains the definition of certain words and expression used in_

the proposed Act.

3. Part II contains provisions relating to the placement of MAS, its wholly
owned subsidiary companies and the partially owned subsidiary companies
listed in paragraph 4(c) under Administration (referred to as the “Administered
Companies”), the effect and duration of the Administration as well as other
related matters pertaining to the appointment, qualifications, powers and
functions of the Administrator.

_Clause 4 provides that a member of MAS or its board of directors may, with_

the prior written approval of the Minister, place the Administered Companies
under administration. The partially owned subsidiary companies listed in
paragraph 4(c) have been identified as those which provide goods or carry
out services or both that are vital to ensure the continuity of the airline and
its operations.

_Clause 5_ empowers the party placing the Administered Companies under

administration to appoint the Administrator. The appointer has the power to
replace the existing Administrator with a new Administrator. _Clause 5 also_
provides that once the Administrator is released from his appointment, he shall
be discharged from all the duties and liabilities in respect of the administration
or in relation to his conduct as Administrator. The immunity conferred on the
Administrator and the circumstances where the immunity will not apply are
set out in _subclause 34(2)._

_Clause 6 sets out the duration of the Administration which commences_

from the date of the appointment of the Administrator under _clause 5 and_
ends when the administration is terminated by the appointer.

_Clause 7 set outs the qualifications to be an Administrator which essentially_

require the Administrator to be a natural person who has consented to
the appointment and who is either a company auditor approved under the
Companies Act 1965 or a person who is capable of performing the duties of
an Administrator.

Further, to ensure that the Administrator is able to carry his functions

and apply his powers independently, _clause 7 disqualifies anyone from being_
appointed as the Administrator if he or she is a mortgagee of any property
of the Administered Companies or has direct or indirect shareholding in the
Administered Companies or is a person who is, directly or indirectly, interested
in any contract or arrangement to provide goods or services to the Administered
Companies or an auditor of the Administered Companies or an officer of the
Administered Companies.


-----

34 _Bill_

_Clause 8_ seeks to require the Administrator to notify the Registrar of

Companies and to publicise his appointment by way of lodgment of a notice
of appointment with the Registrar of Companies and the publication of notice
in the national daily newspapers. _Clause 8_ also mandates that every form of
documentation issued by or on behalf of the Administered Companies or the
Administrator after the appointment of the Administrator shall contain the
words “Administrator Appointed”. This notification requirement is similar
to that imposed by the Companies Act 1965 following the appointment of
a Receiver and Manager and also a Liquidator when a company has been
wound-up.

_Clause 9 sets out the functions of the Administrator which essentially are to_

carry out and manage the business, affairs and operations of the Administered
Companies and the Administrator will assume all the powers conferred on
the directors and carry out the functions of the officers of the Administered
Companies. To this end the Administrator shall also take into custody or
control the property of the Administered Companies.

_Clause 10 sets out the powers of the Administrator for the purpose of the_

administration of the Administered Companies.

_Clause 11 provides that, on the appointment of the Administrator, a moratorium_

which restrains the commencement or continuation of certain legal steps or
action shall take effect on or against the Administered Companies which
would otherwise have adverse legal effect on the Administered Companies
and their property which in turn would defeat the utility and objective of
the Administration of the Administered Companies. The moratorium ensures
that the administration of the Administered Companies can be carried out
effectively and without interruption. However, the moratorium will not apply
to any civil or criminal proceedings taken by a regulatory body against the
Administered Companies.

_Clause 12 provides that the duration of the moratorium shall be twelve_

months from the date the Administrator is appointed unless the administration
is sooner terminated. The moratorium period may also be extended by the
Minister for a further period of not more than twelve months if he is satisfied
that circumstances warrant such an extension. This power of extension is
only exercisable once. If an extension is granted by the Minister, this _clause_
requires the Administrator to publish the notice of the extension in at least two
national daily newspapers; one of which shall be in the national language.

_Clause 13 empowers the Administrator to avoid any transfer, conveyance_

of or creation of security on the goods, monies or other property of the
Administered Companies which, had it been done by or against an individual,
would in his bankruptcy under the law of bankruptcy be void or voidable.

_Clause 14_ empowers the Administrator to direct any transition service

provider who is under a contract or obligation to provide goods or services
to the Administered Companies to continue providing goods or services to
the Malaysia Airlines Berhad and its subsidiary companies instead of the


-----

_Malaysian Airline System Berhad (Administration)_ 35

Administered Companies. The Malaysia Airlines Berhad and its subsidiary
companies are obliged to pay for the goods or services at the same rate paid
by the Administered Companies. The direction by the Administrator shall be
given only for the purpose of ensuring that no disruption of services of the
Malaysia Airlines Berhad and its subsidiary companies.

_Clause 14 also provides that if the transition service provider fails to_

comply with the direction of the Administrator to provide goods or services
to the Malaysia Airlines Berhad, the Minister may, if he thinks necessary for
the public interest, direct the Administrator or any other person appointed by
the Minister to assume control of the whole or part of the property, business
and affairs of a transition service provider so as to ensure that the Malaysia
Airlines Berhad and its subsidiary companies receive the goods and services
they require for the operations of the airline to continue without disruption.
The Minister’s order under clause 14 does not vest the title to or the beneficial
interest in the transition service provider’s property in the Administrator or
such other person appointed by the Minister, as the case may be. The expenses
incurred in carrying out the direction of the Minister shall be payable out
of the assets of the transition service provider in priority to all other claims
whether secured or unsecured.

_Clause 14 further provides that any goods provided or services rendered_

by the transition service provider to the Malaysia Airlines Berhad and its
subsidiary companies is not subject to prior settlement of existing debts by
the Administered Companies to the transition service provider. However, this
does not affect the rights and entitlements of the transition service provider
in recovering those debts owed by the Administered Companies, including
late payment interest.

_Clause 15 sets out the effect of the assumption of control of the property,_

business and affairs of the transition service provider by the Administrator or
any other person pursuant to the direction of the Minister under _clause 14._
This includes submitting the control over the property, business and affairs to
the Administrator or other person appointed by the Minister to take control
of the transition service provider, providing all facilities to the Administrator
or other person appointed by the Minister as may be required to carry on
the business and affairs of the transition service provider. This _clause also_
permits the Administrator or person appointed by the Minister to exercise all
the powers of the transition service provider but only to secure the delivery of
goods or services or both to the Malaysia Airlines Berhad and its subsidiary
companies. In exercising the powers conferred by this clause, the Administrator
or person appointed by the Minister shall not do anything that would disrupt
the business of the transition service provider.

_Clause 16_ empowers the Administrator to require any officer of the

Administered Companies to provide, by way of a statutory declaration, a
statement of affairs of the Administered Companies detailing amongst others
the particulars of all property and liabilities, the names and addresses of the
creditors, securities held by the creditors and the dates when the securities were
given and any other information as may be required by the Administrator.


-----

36 _Bill_

_Clause 17 seeks to require the officer of the Administered Companies to_

assist the Administrator in the investigation of the Administered Companies
by complying with the Administrator’s request to deliver or disclose all books,
records and documents of the Administered Companies or information pertaining
to the location of such books, records and documents. Clause 17 also requires
the officer of the Administered Companies to attend to the Administrator
if so requested for the purpose of providing information pertaining to the
property, affairs and financial circumstance of the Administered Companies.
On completion of the Administration, _clause 17 requires the Administrator to_
return all books, records and documents of the Administered Companies.

4. Part III deals with the administration of the Administered Companies by
the Administrator and includes provisions for appointment of an Independent
Advisor, the qualification of the Independent Advisor, decisions relating to the
proposal prepared by the Administrator and implementation of the proposal.

_Clause 18 empowers the Administrator to either re-negotiate the terms and_

conditions of any contracts or agreements of the Administered Companies or
prepare a proposal with respect to the Administered Companies or to do both
the re-negotiation and preparing a proposal. The proposal prepared may provide
for the transfer of any property, business or liability of the Administered
Companies by means of vesting under Part V or in accordance with the
relevant law applicable to effect the transfer of such property, business or
liability. _Clause 18 requires the Administrator to submit the proposal to the_
Independent Advisor and the appointer.

_Clause 19 sets out the qualifications of an Independent Advisor which must_

either be an investment bank or a firm of accountants or a person (other than
a natural person) permitted to carry on the activity of advising on corporate
finance which is a regulated activity under the Capital Markets and Services
Act 2007 [Act 671] and who, in the opinion of the appointer, has the requisite
experience or is capable of performing the duties of an Independent Advisor.
To ensure impartiality and objectivity in undertaking the review, _clause 19_
provides that any person to be appointed as the Independent Advisor shall
be independent of the appointer, management and board of directors of the
Administered Companies and the Malaysia Airlines Berhad, and has no
interest whatsoever in the Administered Companies and the Malaysia Airlines
Berhad.

_Clause 20 sets out the criteria and consideration which the Independent Advisor_

may take into account when undertaking the review of the Administrator’s
proposal and on the completion of the review, the Independent Advisor
shall prepare and submit a report of the review to the Administrator and the
appointer.
