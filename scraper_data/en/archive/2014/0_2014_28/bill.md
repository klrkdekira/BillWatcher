EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Goods and Services Tax Bill 2014 (“the proposed Act”) seeks to provide
for the imposition and collection of goods and services tax (GST) and for
matters connected therewith. The GST is a broad-based consumption tax based
on a value-added concept. The GST will replace the sales tax and the service
tax currently imposed and collected under the Sales Tax Act 1972 and the
Service Tax Act 1975. Unlike the present sales tax which is a single stage
tax, the GST is a multi-stage tax. Payment of tax is made in stages by the
intermediaries in the production and distribution process. The tax itself is not
a cost to the intermediaries and does not appear as an expense item in their
financial statements.

GST covers all sectors of the industry and is a tax on final consumption of
goods and services. It is collected through a credit system where GST incurred
on inputs is offset against GST charged on outputs.

2. Part I of the proposed Act deals with preliminary matters.

_Clause 1_ provides for the short title and the power of the Minister to

appoint the date of commencement of the proposed Act.

_Clause 2_ contains the definitions of the words and expressions used in the

proposed Act.


-----

164 _Bill_

_Clause 3 seeks to provide for the general meaning of business in the proposed_

Act which includes the activities of clubs and similar organizations, and paid
admission into premises. This _clause_ also seeks to extend the meaning of
business to include the commencement, termination or intended termination
of business and disposal of assets or transfer of business as a going concern
to be a supply made in the course or furtherance of business.

_Clause 4_ seeks to provide for the meaning of supply and the supply of

goods or the supply of services, as well as matters that are to be treated as
a supply of goods or a supply of services as listed in the First Schedule and
matters that are to be treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of
services as listed in the Second Schedule. This _clause_ also gives power to
the Minister to amend the First and Second Schedules.

3. Part II sets out the administration of the GST.

_Clause 5_ seeks to provide that the Director General has superintendence

over all matters relating to GST. A senior officer of goods and services tax
shall have and exercise all the powers of the Director General other than the
powers conferred under sections 8, 62, 76, 77, 172 and 173.

_Clause 6_ seeks to require officers of goods and services tax to identify

themselves when performing their duties and any person may refuse an order
made by the officers if they do not identify themselves. This _clause_ also
provides that unlawfully wearing, using, possessing or displaying an authority
card or badge of an officer of goods and services tax is an offence.

_Clause 7_ seeks to provide that all officers of goods and services tax shall

be deemed to be public servants.

_Clause 8 deals with the confidentiality of all documents handled by officers_

of goods and services tax or any other government officers having official
duties. It shall be an offence for any person who misuses any information or
documents other than for the purposes of carrying on his duties. This _clause_
allows the officer of goods and services tax not to divulge any information or
document to any person except in the course of carrying out his duties as an
officer of goods and services tax or in the case of prosecution of an offence in
court. The Director General may share information with the Director General
of Inland Revenue and the Chief Statistician in the performance of his official
government duties. This _clause_ also empowers the Minister to disclose any
information or document to any person he deems fit.

4. Part III contains provisions relating to the imposition and scope of tax.

_Clause 9 seeks to provide for the chargeability of tax on any taxable supply_

made in Malaysia by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of business
and includes goods and services supplied locally as well as imported except
in the case of imported services or any local recipient under Approved Toll
Manufacturer Scheme where a non-taxable person is allowed to charge tax.
This _clause_ places the liability of tax on the person who makes the supply
except in the case of an auctioneer or a person who sells goods belonging
to a taxable person in satisfaction of a debt to be liable to account for tax


-----

_Goods and Services Tax_ 165

even though they are not making the supply. It further provides for GST to
be charged and payable on all importation of goods into Malaysia as if it
were customs duty or excise duty. Any registered person must display price
of the goods or services inclusive of tax. If he requires to display the price
exclusive of tax, he is required to apply to the Director General for approval.
It also provides for contravention of this _clause to be an offence._

_Clause 10_ seeks to provide for the tax to be charged on the value of the

supply or importation based on the rate of tax as determined by the Minister.
This _clause_ provides for the procedure in fixing the tax rate and a refund of
tax may be made under specified conditions.

_Clause 11_ seeks to provide for the time of supply rules and determines

the general time of supply rules for goods and services. It also determines
the time of supply to be triggered when a tax invoice is issued or payment is
received whichever is the earlier. The time of supply is the date the invoice
is issued if the invoice is issued within 21 days after the supply is made.
This _clause_ allows the Director General to determine the time of supply
under special circumstances such as when goods are transferred or disposed
of and privately used, one-off use or as and when it is used. This _clause_
also provides for exceptions to the general rule on the time of supply under
certain circumstances and the application of those sections for supply made
separately and successively as prescribed under the regulations to be made
under the proposed Act.

_Clause 12_ seeks to provide for the place of supply rules for the purposes

of chargeability of tax and determine the place of supply for goods. The
place of supply is in Malaysia if the supply is made from a place in Malaysia
to another place in Malaysia or if the goods are removed from a place in
Malaysia to a place outside Malaysia. The place of supply is treated to be
outside Malaysia if the goods are brought in from a place outside Malaysia.
This _clause_ also determines the place of supply for services. If the supplier
belongs in Malaysia then the place of supply is in Malaysia.

_Clause 13_ sets out the treatment of imported services as a supply made

by the recipient and the chargeability of and liability to pay tax on imported
services by a taxable person and any person other than a taxable person. It also
provides for the time of supply to be the time when payment is made by the
recipient and the non-applicability of the section to any supply of goods under
any lease agreement, from a person who does not belong in Malaysia.

_Clause 14_ seeks to determine the country where the supplier or recipient

of services belong based on his business or fixed establishment or his usual
place of residence in that country. This _clause_ also seeks to provide for any
business establishment to be regarded as belonging in Malaysia if the business
establishment has a branch or agency in Malaysia.

_Clause 15_ seeks to provide the rules in determining the value of supply

except as provided for in the Third Schedule that is the value of supply to
be the consideration in money excluding tax. It also provides for the value
of supply (which includes excise duty) to be determined by using the open
market value less tax chargeable under certain circumstances where there


-----

166 _Bill_

is no consideration or the consideration is not wholly in money. Where
the consideration covers more than one supply, the _clause_ seeks to require
apportioning the consideration received that is attributable to the supply. This
_clause_ seeks to empower the Minister to amend the Third Schedule and to
determine the value of supply under special circumstances.

_Clause 16 seeks to provide for the computation of value of goods imported_

for the purposes of charging GST.

_Clause 17_ seeks to empower the Minister to treat any supply of goods or

services as a zero-rated supply by way of an order published in the _Gazette._
The supply of goods if the goods are exported is also treated as a zero-rated
supply. The supply of goods or services which are zero-rated shall be treated
as a taxable supply and shall be charged at zero per cent. This clause provides
for the liability to pay tax and the seizure of goods that are claimed to have
been exported but found in Malaysia.

_Clause 18_ seeks to empower the Minister to determine any supply of

goods or services to be an exempt supply by way of an order published in
the _Gazette_ whereby no tax is to be charged on the exempt supply.

5. Part IV sets out the provisions for the registration of taxable persons.

_Clause 19 seeks to provide for the general provisions for the registration of_

taxable persons. It also provides for any reference to a supply to be confined
to a supply made for business purposes and that the value of the supply would
be taken as tax exclusive.

_Clause 20_ seeks to empower the Minister to determine the threshold level

for mandatory registration by way of an order published in the _Gazette. This_
_clause_ provides for the computation of annual turnover for the purposes of
determining the liability to be registered. The value of supplies made during
the period in which the taxable person was previously registered, the value
of sale of capital assets, imported services, supplies made within or between
designated areas and supplies made by a toll manufacturer for a foreign
principal are excluded. Supplies made within or between designated areas will
not include supplies that the Minister prescribes as taxable in the designated
areas. This _clause_ also provides for the use of a prescribed form in making
an application to be registered.

_Clause 21 seeks to require a person to notify his liability to register within_

28 days from the end of his liability to register and the registration date to
start on the first day after the month in which he makes the notification
to register or an earlier date as may be agreed. This _clause_ also requires a
person to notify his liability to the Director General within 28 days from the
date when the business is transferred and Director General shall register him
accordingly. The Director General may predetermine a registration date if the
person fails to notify his liability to register. Any reference to registration of
persons shall refer to registration in a register kept by the Director General.
If a person fails to register within the stipulated period he shall be liable to
pay late registration penalty based on the period he is late for registration.


-----

_Goods and Services Tax_ 167

_Clause 22_ deals with the cessation of a person’s liability to be registered.

This _clause_ further provides that the liability to register does not cease if
the person’s annual turnover has not exceeded the threshold due to expected
cessation of making taxable supplies or suspension of making taxable supplies
for 30 days or more. It excludes the value of sale of capital assets, imported
services, supplies made within or between designated areas and supplies made
by a toll manufacturer for a foreign principal for the purposes of determining
the end of liability to be registered. Supplies made within or between designated
areas will not include the supplies that the Minister has prescribed as taxable
in the designated areas.

_Clause 23_ seeks to empower the Director General to direct two or more

taxable persons to be registered as a single taxable person. It explains the
determination of artificial separation of business to take into consideration the
extent of financial, economic and organizational links. The Director General
shall make the direction subject to certain conditions specified. Each direction
is to be served on every person named. This _clause_ also gives power to the
Director General to direct another person other than those persons named in
the earlier direction. Upon the revocation of a registered person (to end his
liability) if he is named as one of the persons in the direction, he together with
all other persons shall be registered as a single taxable person. The persons
named in the direction are to be known as constituent members after they are
registered. It stipulates the responsibilities of the single taxable person and the
treatment of constituent members as a partnership. The Director General may
disregard a person to be a constituent member and that person shall cease to
have any liability after he has ceased to be a member of the partnership.

_Clause 24_ seeks to allow for voluntary registration of any person who is

not liable to be registered, subject to certain conditions. Upon registration, the
person shall remain to be registered for a period of not less than two years.
This _clause_ also allows for voluntary registration of a person who makes or
intends to make a taxable supply outside Malaysia. This _clause_ provides for
the use of a prescribed form in making the application to be registered and
enables the Director General to cancel the registration of a person if he does
not make a taxable supply by the stipulated date or he has breached any
conditions imposed.

_Clause 25_ seeks to require a person to notify the Director General within

a stipulated period if he ceases to make a taxable supply or intends to cease
making a taxable supply.

_Clause 26_ seeks to allow the Director General to cancel a person’s

registration upon request or notification if he is satisfied that such person
can be deregistered. This _clause_ also allows the Director General to cancel
the person’s registration if he is satisfied that the person has ceased to be
registrable effective from the date he so ceases or such later date or if he is
neither liable nor eligible to be registered.

_Clause 27_ seeks to allow two or more companies to apply for group

registration if certain conditions are satisfied. The registration of the group shall
be in the name of the representative member. This clause further provides for
the treatment of supplies between members of a group and the joint liability
of every member of a group.


-----

168 _Bill_

_Clause 28 seeks to provide for the registration of partnership in the name of_

the firm and that any changes in the partnership shall not affect the registration
and accounting for tax. A partner is liable to notify in writing to the Director
General that he has ceased to be a partner and he is also liable to pay any tax
due until the date of cessation as a partner. This _clause_ also seeks to provide
that any service of notice to the firm during the taxable period in which the
partner is liable shall be treated as having been served on him although he
has ceased to be a partner. Further, the serving of notice to the firm shall be
deemed to have been served on a partnership. Any notice given by any partner
shall be deemed as a notice given by all partners of the firm. It shall be an
offence if a person does not notify in writing to the Director General of his
date of cessation as a partner in the partnership or fails to pay his proportion
of tax due and payable. This _clause_ further seeks to exclude limited liability
partnership.

_Clause 29_ seeks to provide for the registration of societies and similar

him that he is prevented from leaving the country and any non-receipt of the
notice does not prevent the police or immigration from performing his duties.

deemed to have claimed his input tax or refund if the transferor has claimed
for input tax or refund. Similarly, if it is the liability of the transferor to
furnish a tax return, account and pay tax, it shall also be the liability of the
transferee to do so. Where the transferor is approved to account tax on payment

return. However, if he is not a taxable person, he is liable for any tax due
on the supply.
