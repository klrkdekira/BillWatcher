Explanatory Statement

This Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1967 (“Act 53”), the Petroleum
(Income Tax) Act 1967 (“Act 543”) and the Real Property Gains Tax Act
1976 (“Act 169”).

Amendments to the Income Tax Act 1967

Chapter II of this Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1967.

1. Clause 4 seeks to redraft the proviso to subsection 5(1) of Act 53 as new
subsection 5(1a). The new subsection 5(1a) also provides that any amount
received by a person which is subject to tax under section 109g of Act 53
shall be excluded for the purpose of ascertaining his chargeable income.
Currently, only the income which is subject to tax under section 109c or 109e of
Act 53 is excluded.

This amendment has effect for the year of assessment 2015 and for subsequent

years of assessment.

2. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 29 of Act 53.

_Paragraph 5(a)(ii) seeks to introduce a new paragraph 29(3)(aa) into Act 53_

to provide that where gross income from a source in Malaysia of the relevant
person consists of interest that relates to a loan between individuals who are
relatives of each other, the relevant person is deemed to be able to obtain on
demand the receipt of such interest when such interest is due to be paid to
the relevant person in the relevant period.

_Subclause 5(b)_ seeks to introduce new subsections 29(4) and (5) into Act 53.

The proposed subsection 29(4) seeks to provide that where a relevant person
is entitled to any gross income accruing in or derived from Malaysia to
which section 25, section 27 other than subsection 27(1a), or section 28 of
Act 53 applies (such as gross income from employment, interest, discount,
rent, royalty or any pension, annuity or other periodical payment), the person
is deemed to be able to obtain on demand the receipt of such amount in the
basis period immediately following the relevant period if such amount first
becomes receivable to the relevant person in the relevant period. The gross
income in the proposed subsection 29(4) relates to transactions involving
persons one of whom has control over the other, between individuals who
are relatives of each other or between persons both of whom are controlled
by some other person. The proposed subsection 29(5) seeks to introduce the
definitions of “relative” and “transaction”.

These amendments have effect for the year of assessment 2015 and for

subsequent years of assessment.

3. Clause 6 seeks to amend subsection 46(1) of Act 53.


-----

20 _Bill_

_Subclause 6(a) seeks to amend paragraph 46(1)(d)_ of Act 53 to increase

the personal deduction for an individual from a maximum of five thousand
ringgit to six thousand ringgit in respect of a purchase of any necessary basic
supporting equipment for the individual’s own use, if he is a disabled person,
or the individual’s spouse, child or parent who is a disabled person.
