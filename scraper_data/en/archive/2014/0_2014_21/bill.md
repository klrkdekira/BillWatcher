EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996
(“Act 555”).

3. Clause 2 seeks to delete section 22 of Act 555 on the requirement for

to the education sector.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to introduce saving and transitional provisions.

Where an invitation has been made by the Minister under section 22 of

by the proposed Act as provided in _clause 2._

Where an application is made pursuant to an invitation made by the Minister

under section 22 of Act 555 immediately before the commencement of the
proposed Act, such application shall be dealt with as if section 22 of Act 555
had not been deleted by the proposed Act as provided in _clause 2._

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
