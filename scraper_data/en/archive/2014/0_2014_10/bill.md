explanatory statement

This Bill seeks to amend the Registration of Engineers Act 1967 (“Act 138”).
The proposed amendments seek to primarily liberalise the engineering profession
in Malaysia and to provide for related matters.

2. _Clause 1 provides for the short title and the power of the Minister to_
appoint the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to provide for the general amendment by substituting the words_
“registered Engineer” and “registered Engineers” wherever appearing in Act 138.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 138 to introduce new definitions_
and to amend existing definitions used in Act 138.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 138 to require certain members of_
the Board to be from amongst registered Professional Engineers with Practising
Certificates. Where the Council of the Institution of Engineers (Malaysia)
fails to nominate any Professional Engineer with Practising Certificate as
members of the Board within thirty days before the expiry of the term of
office of members of the Board, the Minister is empowered to proceed with
the appointment of the members of the Board under this _clause._

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 138 to enable the Board to appoint_
a committee to conduct a professional assessment examination for admission as
a Professional Engineer and to conduct a professional competency examination
for issuance of a Practising Certificate to a Professional Engineer.

7. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 5 of Act 138 to include the particulars of_
the Professional Engineers with Practising Certificates, Engineering Technologists
and Inspectors of Works in the Register.

8. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 138 to allow the Registrar to_
publish in any other media including electronic media other than the _Gazette_
and national newspaper the particulars of a registered Person whose registration
has been suspended, cancelled, removed and reinstated under Act 138.

9. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 7 of Act 138 to provide for restrictions_
on a Professional Engineer with Practising Certificate, Graduate Engineer,
Engineering Technologist and Inspector of Works relating to the performance
of professional engineering services and the use of any name, style or title
to describe or hold himself out as a registered Person under Act 138.


-----

engineers holding a qualification which is recognized by the Board to be
registered as Professional Engineers with Practising Certificates.
