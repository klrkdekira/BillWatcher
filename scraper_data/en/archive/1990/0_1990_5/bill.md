EXPLANATORY STATEMENT


_Act 235._


This Bill seeks to amend the Goods Vehicle Levy Act 1983
(hereinafter referred to as "the Act").

2. Clause 2 seeks to define "proper officer of customs" as having
the same meaning assigned to that term in the Customs Act 1967.

3. Clause 3 seeks to legalise and validate the collection of goods
vehicle levies of one hundred ringgit on every goods vehicle made
since the 1st January 1984 pursuant to a 1983 Order which due to
oversight was not laid on the table of the Dewan Rakyat as
required. Hence the said Order ceased to have effect. Clause 3
also seeks to fix the amount of the goods vehicle levy in the Act at
one hundred ringgit and to give the power to the Minister from
time to time to vary the amount of the levy.

4. Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new subsection (2), empowering
the Minister to direct the refund of any levy already paid in respect
of any particular goods vehicle or class of goods vehicle.

5. Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new section 4A to the Act,
empowering the Director General to order the refund of moneys
collected as goods vehicle levy, if he is satisfied that it is overpaid
or erroneously paid if a claim is made within one year after the
payment is made.

4 BILL

6. Clause 6 seeks to substitute a new subsection (2) for
subsection (2) of section 7 of the Act. At present, officers required
to enforce and ensure due compliance with the Act are required to
be designated by notification in the Gazette. In effect these officers
are customs officers appointed under the Customs Act 1967 to
carry out their duties in addition to their duties under the 1967
Act. The process of gazetting these customs officers specially for
the purpose of the Act appears to be not practical. Hence the
proposed amendment seeks to do away with the process and to
grant such officers the necessary duties and powers under the Act.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (IP) 1459.]
