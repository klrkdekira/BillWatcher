INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) 3

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1967. These amendments
are consequential to the introduction of the Labuan Offshore Business
Activity Tax Bill 1990.

2. Clause 1 contains the preliminary provisions. The Bill will be
effective from the year of assessment 1991.

3. Clause 2 seeks to introduce new definitions of "offshore business
activity" and "offshore company" in section 2 of the Act.

4. Clause 3 provides that tax shall not be charged on the income of
an offshore company in respect of income from its offshore business
activity.

5. Clause 4 provides that the provisions of section 108 of the Act
relating to deduction of tax from dividends shall not apply to an
offshore company in respect of dividends distributed out of income
derived from an offshore business activity or income exempt from
income tax.

6. Under the existing legislation, where a company receives
Malaysian dividend from which tax has been deducted, the tax so
deducted can be set off against the tax charged on the income of the
company. Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new section 110A to the Act so
that an offshore company receiving Malaysian dividend from which
tax has been deducted is not entitled to claim any set-off in respect of
the tax so deducted against the tax charged on its income.

7. Clause 6 proposes a new section 111 A to the Act so that an offshore
company receiving Malaysian dividend from which tax has been
deducted is not entitled to any refund of the tax so deducted.

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1618.]
