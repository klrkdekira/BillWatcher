EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill is enacted under Article 149 of the Federal Constitution to amend
the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act 1985 (which is
referred to in this Statement as the "Act").

2. Subsection (1) of section 6 of the Act empowers the Minister to make
a detention order directing a person to be detained for a period not
exceeding two years from the date of such order. Clause 2 of the Bill seeks
to amend that subsection to. remove the words "from the date of such
order", so as to bring it in line with other similar laws.

3. Clause 3 seeks to introduce anew subsection (2) into section 6A of the
Act. The new subsection provides that where a fresh detention order or
restriction order is made after a previous detention order or restriction
order is revoked, that fresh order is valid notwithstanding that no fresh
report has been submitted under subsection (3) of section 3 and subsection
(4) of section 5 of the Act or that that fresh order was made on the same
ground as the previous order.

4. Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend subsection (2) of section 11 B of the
Act to make it clear that the "fresh order" referred to in that subsection is
a fresh order under subsection (1) or subsection (3) of section 6 of the Act
and that the "fresh direction" referred to in that subsection is a fresh
direction under subsection (1) of section 11 A of the Act.

5. Clause 5 (1) seeks to validate any detention order made, and any
detention effected in pursuance of that order, after the commencement of
the Act but before the commencement of the proposed amendment where
such detention order commenced from a date other than the date on which
it was made or where the detention order is a fresh detention order made
after the revocation of a previous detention order.


-----

4 BILL

_Clause 5 (2) seeks to prohibit any action, suit, prosecution or any other_
proceeding from being brought, instituted or maintained in respect of any
detention order or detention validated under clause 5 (1). This prohibition,
however, does not apply to any legal proceeding where the court has given
its final decision before the commencement of this Bill, or where there is
an appeal in respect of such decision.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1604.]
