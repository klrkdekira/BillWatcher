[ ]

BE IT ENACTED by the Duli Yang Maha Mulia Sen
Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong with the advice and

(2) This Act shall come into force on such date as the

2 BILL

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1967.

2. The existing section 14 (3) of the Act provides that a collective
agreement shall not contain terms which are less favourable than the
provisions of the Wages Council Act 1947 and the Employment Act 1955.
_Clause 2 seeks to amend this section to remove any false impression that_
those two Acts are applicable to employees not covered by the said Acts
or that the Employment Act 1955, which applies only in West Malaysia,
extends to Sabah and Sarawak and thereby indirectly extending their scope
of application.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 27 (1) (c) to allow workmen who are
members of a trade union to be represented by their trade union in
proceedings before the Industrial Court.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN. (U[2]) 1598.]
