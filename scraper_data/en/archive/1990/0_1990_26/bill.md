"offshore bank". An offshore bank granted a licence under this Bill is a
''licensed offshore bank" and if the licensed offshore bank is a branch or

a "licensed Malaysian offshore bank".

_Clause 2 (2) explains that where any person is required to submit,_

produce or provide to the Bank any information, statistics, return or

document, the Bank is empowered to specify various matters and details
such as the intervals, the manner, the form and the means in or by which
such submission, production or provision is to be made and such person
is prohibited from submitting, producing or providing as true any
information, statistics, return or document which he knows or believes
to be false, inaccurate or misleading.

4. Clause 3 makes it clear that the functions, powers and duties
conferred on the Bank under this Bill shall not derogate from or
prejudice the functions, powers and duties conferred on the Bank under
any other written law.

5. _Clause 4 prohibits any person from carrying on offshore banking_

business unless such person is an offshore company or a foreign offshore
company incorporated or registered, as the case may be, under the

business.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to create a legal regime for offshore banking business to
be conducted in, from and through the Federal Territory of Labuan by
offshore banks. The Bill seeks to provide new laws, inter alia, for —

_(a) the licensing and regulation of offshore banking business and_

persons carrying on offshore banking business;

_(b) the protection of the secrecy of information relating to the_

identity, affairs and accounts of customers of offshore banks
licensed under this Bill; and

_(c) other necessary and incidental matters such as the appointment_

of auditors, submission of aggregated statistics and financial
statements, sanctions for contravention of the Bill, control of
dealings in Malaysian currency, power of Bank Negara
Malaysia ("the Bank") to make regulations, power of an
offshore bank to allow withdrawals from a deceased person's
account, the application of related legislation such as the


-----

26 BILL

6. _Clause 5 sets out the procedure for the application for an offshore_

banking licence and the documents including financial statements to be
submitted together with the application. The applicant is also required
to secure a guarantee and to give an undertaking that it will comply with
the financial obligations imposed under this Bill and to meet its
liabilities in respect of its business in the Federal Territory of Labuan
and not to change its participants who each holds ten per centum or more
of its paid-up capital without the approval of the Bank. Clause 5 (4)
enables the Bank to seek such additional information or documents as it
may require for the purpose of determining the suitability of the
applicant for the licence.

7. _Clause 6(2) empowers the Minister, after consideration of the_

application and the Bank's recommendation under clause 6(1), to either
grant or refuse to grant the licence. The Bank is required to promptly
notify the applicant in writing whether its application is granted or
refused. Any licence granted to the applicant under clause 6(2) is
prohibited from being transferred to another person. Every licence
granted to any applicant under clause 6(2) is required to be assigned its
distinctive licence number and, under clause 6 (4), the Bank is required
to promptly notify every applicant, whose application for a licence is
granted, of its licence number. Clause 6(5) provides that a licence
granted in respect of an application by an applicant under clause 5(3)
shall take effect only on the date of incorporation or registration of the
company concerned.

8. _Clause 7(1) and(2) requires alicensed offshore bank to prominently_

affix or paint at its offices, and also prominently print on its stationery
and advertisements, its name, the words "licensed offshore bank" and its
licence number. Clause 7(3) prohibits the use of the phrase "offshore
bank" or its derivatives in any language by a person who is not a licensed
offshore bank.

9. Clause 8 sets out the grounds for revocation of a licence. These
include, inter alia, contravention of any written law, the provision of any
false or misleading information in connection with an application for a
licence and the failure to honour any guarantee or undertaking given in
connection with the application for a licence.

10. Clause 9 provides that a licensed offshore bank may surrender its

licence after obtaining approval from the Bank. A notice of any such
surrender of licence has to be published in the Gazette by the Bank as
soon as practicable.

11. _Clause 10 provides that any offshore bank which has surrendered_

its licence or whose licence has been revoked shall cease to carry on
offshore banking business. However, primarily for the purposes of
winding up its affairs, the Minister may, on the recommendation of the
Bank, authorise the offshore bank to carry on such activities for such
duration as he may specify in the authorisation.

OFFSHORE BANKING 27

12. _Clause 11 prohibits a licence from being granted to an offshore_

bank if its paid-up capital and reserves are less than ten million ringgit.
A licensed offshore bank, unless otherwise permitted by the Minister, is
also prohibited from carrying on offshore banking business if its paid-
up capital and reserves, unimpaired by losses, are less than ten million
ringgit.

13. _Clause 12 (1) restricts a licensed Malaysian offshore bank from_

altering or amending its constituent documents unless approved by the
Bank. Authenticated particulars of any alterations or amendments to
constituent documents of a licensed offshore bank have to be submitted
to the Bank within three months of the making of such alterations or
amendments. Clause 12 (3) prohibits the making of any such amendment
or alteration which is contrary to any written law.

14. _Clause 13 places a duty on the Bank to publish an updated list of_

all licensed offshore banks and their licence numbers in the Gazette.

15. _Clause 14 prohibits a licensed offshore bank from carrying on_

offshore banking business in, from or through any place in Malaysia
other than in the Federal Territory of Labuan and from opening any
office in the Federal Territory of Labuan other than its principal place
of business. If the offshore bank is an offshore company, it is also
prohibited from opening any office or acquiring or establishing any
subsidiary in the Federal Territory of Labuan and in any place outside
Malaysia except with the consent of the Bank.

16. Clause 15 prohibits a licensed offshore bank from opening certain
types of account or any account for a customer whose identity is not
known to it.

17. Clause 16 requires a licensed offshore bank to appoint annually an

approved auditor to carry out an audit of its accounts, to comment on its
accounting systems and controls and to submit a report to its participants
and to the Bank on these matters. The Bank is empowered under clause
_16 (3) to seek clarifications in respect of the report from the approved_
auditor without breaching clause 21 of this Bill.

18. Clause 17 requires the accounts and financial statements of a

licensed offshore bank to be submitted to the Bank within three months
of the close of its financial year. Its approved accounts have to be
submitted to the Bank within fourteen days of the date of approval of the
accounts.

19. Clause 18 requires an offshore bank to submit an assets and

liabilities statement to the Bank. The information submitted under
_clause 18 to the Bank is to be secret as between the offshore bank and_
the Bank but clause 18 or any other secrecy provision in any other
written law will not preclude the Bank from publishing a consolidated
statement aggregating the figures in the assets and liabilities statements
submitted to it.


-----

28 BILL

20. Clause 19 requires a licensed offshore bank to pay such annual
licence fees as may be set out in the regulations made under this Bill.

21. _Clause 20(1) prohibits licensed offshore banks from transacting_

any business, or dealing, in Malaysian currency. Clause 20(2) however
allows the buying and selling of foreign currency against Malaysian
currency and swap transactions. The rationale for this provision is to
prevent the internationalisation of the ringgit and also to permit
transactions normally carried out by offshore banks. These transactions
are nevertheless subject to the Exchange Control Act 1953. Clause 20
_(3) provides that any offshore bank which contravenes clause 20(1)_
shall be guilty of an offence, and on conviction is punishable with a fine
not exceeding the amount of Malaysian currency which is the subject
matter of the offence and, in the case of a continuing offence, with
additional daily fine not exceeding fifty per centum of the amount of
Malaysian currency which is the subject matter of the offence. Clause
_20(4) provides that any director or officer of a licensed offshore bank_

who abets, consents or conspires in the commission of the offence shall
also be guilty of an offence, and on conviction is punishable with
imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or with a fine not
exceeding five million ringgit or with both such imprisonment and fine.

22. _Clause 21 precludes the Minister from directing the Bank to_

inquire, and the Bank itself from inquiring, specifically into the identity,
account or affairs of any particular customer of any licensed offshore
bank.

23. Clause 22 provides for banking secrecy, in particular for the
maintenance of the secrecy of information relating to the affairs or the
account of any particular customer of an offshore bank by the directors
and officers of the offshore bank and by any person, including Bank
Negara Malaysia and its directors and officers, who for any reason has
by any means access to any record, book, register or correspondence of
the customer. It also prohibits any person who has any information or
document in contravention of clause 22 (1) from further disclosing such
information or document to any other person. The prohibition however
does not apply to the disclosure of any information or document which
the customer or his personal representative has given consent in writing
to be disclosed or the disclosure of any information or document under
an order of the High Court under the circumstances specified therein. In
addition, the provisions of Bankers' Book (Evidence) Act 1949, except
section 7, will continue to be applicable to licensed offshore banks.

24. Clause 23 empowers the Bank to examine under conditions of
secrecy the books and other documents of a licensed offshore bank to
verify its submissions under clauses 17 and 18. The proviso to this
_clause makes it clear that the power to examine books and documents_
under this clause does not authorise the Bank to inquire specifically into
the identity, account or affairs of any particular customer of the offshore
bank.

OFFSHORE BANKING 29

25. _Clause 24 (1) renders any contravention of any provision of this_

Bill a criminal offence. Clause 24 (2) provides for the punishment for the
more serious offences under this Bill, namely, contravention of clause
_4, clause 10. clause 15, clause 22 (1) and clause 22 (2), which is a term_
of imprisonment not exceeding five years or a fine not exceeding ten
million ringgit or both, and in the case of a continuing offence, an

additional daily fine of ten thousand ringgit for each day the offence
continues to be committed. For other offences under this Bill, clause 24
_(3) provides a general penalty of three years imprisonment or five_
million ringgit fine or both and, in the case of a continuing offence, a
daily fine of five thousand ringgit for each day the offence continues to
be committed.

26. Clause 25 gives the Governor of the Bank the power to compound
any offence under this Bill.

27. Clause 26 provides an indemnity for the Government, the Bank
and the officers of the Government and the Bank from any legal
proceedings in respect of their duties, powers and functions under this
Bill which are discharged in good faith.

28. Clause 27 empowers the Minister, on recommendation of the

Bank, to make regulations under this Bill,

29. _Clause 28 clarifies that the proposed Offshore Companies Act_

1990 applies to offshore banks which are offshore companies or foreign

offshore companies, and the Companies Act 1965 applies to offshore
banks which are branches of Malaysian banks, in addition to the
provisions of this Bill. However, in the event that there is any conflict
or inconsistency between the provisions of those Acts and this Bill, the
provisions of this Bill shall prevail. Clause 28 (3) empowers the
Minister to resolve by a direction in writing any difficulty or doubt
arising from the application of clause 28.

30. _Clause 29 provides that the Exchange Control Act 1953 shall_

prevail over the provisions of this Bill.

31. _Clause 30 provides that the Banking and Financial Institutions Act_

1989 and the Islamic Banking Act 1983 shall not apply to licensed

offshore banks.

32. Clause 31 provides for the power of the Minister to exempt, on the
recommendation of the Bank, any person from all or any of the provision
of this Bill.

33. _Clause 32 (1) provides for the convenient withdrawal by a_

beneficiary of a deceased person's deposits, not exceeding five thousand
ringgit, with a licensed offshore bank, without the production of letters


-----

**30** **BILL**

of probate or letters of administration. The beneficiary however has to
produce satisfactory proof of the death of such deceased person and his
entitlement to the sum standing to the credit of such deceased person.
The licensed offshore bank is empowered to pay the money to the
beneficiary if it has received no other claims to such money. Clause 32
_(3) provides an indemnity for a licensed offshore bank against any_
liability arising from any payment under clause 32 (1); however, the

person to whom the payment was made is open to any claim in respect
of the said payment.

**_FINANCIAL_** **_IMPLICATIONS_**

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1611.]
