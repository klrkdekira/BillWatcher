EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Pensions Act 1980 (hereinafter referred
to as "the Act").

_2. Clause 2 seeks to amend the Act by introducing a new section_
6A to provide that new officers appointed on or after the coming into
force of this Act, before being confirmed in his appointment, will
be given an option to opt for the Employees Provident Fund Scheme. If
such officer opts for the Employees Provident Fund Scheme, the provisions of the Act, except the provisions stated under that clause, which
relates to compulsory retirement and retirement under subsection (5) of
section 10 of the Act, shall not apply to him. The exercise of the option is
irrevocable.

Amendment
of section 13.

Amendment
of section 23.

**BILL**

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 10 of the Act to include another ground
for the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the State Authority, as the case may be,
to retire an officer from the public service. Any officer who, at the time of
his appointment, made any statement or gave any information or supplied
any document which is found to be false, erroneous, inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading or likely to mislead, may be retired under section
10 of the Act.

5. Clause 5 seeks to substitute section 12 of the Act to lower the optional
retirement age from forty-five years of age for women and fifty years of
age for men to forty years of age for women and men. However, a pension,
gratuity or other benefit may only be granted to such officers on attaining
the age of forty-five years, or fifty years, or fifty-five years, as the case may
be, as specified under that clause.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 13 of the Act to clearly specify the
power to pay pension, gratuity or other benefit to an officer wbo is retired
under section I0(5)(d) and to provide for power to pay pension, gratuity
or other benefit to an officer who may be retired under the proposed section
_10(5)(f)._

7. Clause 7seeks to amend subsection (2) of section 23 of the Act relating
to the power of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to suspend the pension of an
officer who has been retired at the instance of the Government under
section 11(a)(i) or 11(b)(i) of the Act if that officer is involved in any
activity which may be in conflict with the purpose of his retirement. This
amendment is necessary as a consequence of the amendment made to
section 11 of the Act earlier by the Pensions (Amendment) Act 1986, but
the reference to section 11 (b)(i), which is in relation to State officers, shall
only apply to officers appointed to the public service after the commencement of this Bill, as there,is no existing provision in the Act for the Yang
di-Pertuan Agong to suspend the pension of such officers at present.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2])1481.]
