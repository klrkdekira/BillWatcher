EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Copyright Act 1987.

2. In view of the Government's decision for Malaysia to become a party
to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works
1886 (including all acts, protocols and revisions thereto) (hereinafter
referred to as "the Beme Convention"), the proposed Bill primarily seeks
to make the provisions of the Act not only compatible with the provisions
of the Berne Convention but also to enable Malaysia to fulfill her
obligations, upon becoming a party to the Berne Convention, under the
Berne Convention. Clauses 2, 6,7,8,19,20 and 21 therefore seek to amend
the Copyright Act 1987 towards these ends.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section2oftheActsoastomakeitclear that_
though the Act is therein stated to apply to works made before the
commencement of the Act as it applies to works made after the
commencement of the Act, the Act's application to "foreign works"
by virtue of the Berne Convention will have to be subjected to the
provisions of the new section 59A, as introduced by clause 21, and
regulations made under section 59A.


Amendment
of section 61.


-----

14 BILL

4. _Clause6 seeks to amend section I3oftheAct to firstly, provide more_
specifically copyright in the activities described in paragraphs (b) and (e)
of subsection (1) of section 13, Secondly, to delete the proviso to subsection (1) in view of the difficulties posed by having to comply with its
provisions. Thirdly, to amend subsection (2) so as to provide in subsection
(2) as many areas of activities as are permissable under the terms of the
Berne Convention which are not subject to copyright control. Of
particular note is the introduction of new paragraphs (ff), (gg) and (ggg)
where any use of a work for the purpose of an examination by way of
setting the questions, communicating the questions to the candidates or
answering the questions; the making of a sound recording of a broadcast,
a literary, dramatic or musical work, sound recording or a film included
in a broadcast insofar as it consists of sounds if such sound recording is
for the private and domestic use of the person by whom the sound
recording is made; and the making of a film of a broadcast, or a literary,
artistic, dramatic or musical work or a film included in the broadcast
insofar as it consists of visual images if such making of a film of the
broadcast is for the private and domestic use of the person by whom the
film is made, respectively, are exempted from copyright control. Paragraph
(l)of subsection (2) of section 13 of the Act has been amended to provide
further for the exclusion of copyright control over any use of a work for
the purposes of the proceedings of a royal commission, a legislative body,
a statutory or Governmental inquiry or for the purpose of reporting any
such proceedings. Fourthly, to make consequential amendments to
section 13.

5. Clauses 7 and 19 seek to make consequential amendments to sections
15 and 58 (2) of the Act respectively in view of the amendments made to
section 13.

6. _Clause 8 seeks to delete the whole of section 24 which has been_
generally viewed as being incompatible with the Berne Convention.

_7. Clause 20 seeks to amend section 59 of the Act by taking out the_
aspect of the Minister making regulations extending the application of the
Act in respect of such works referred to in subsection (1) of section 7 to
individuals in, bodies corporate established in or under the laws of, works
first published in, works of architecture erected in a building located in,
broadcasts transmitted from, a country which is a party to a treaty or a
member of any Convention or Union to which Malaysia is also a party or
a member and which treaty or Convention provides for protection of
copyright in works. This aspect of section 59 is provided for by clause 21
which seeks to introduce a new section 59A to the Act. The new section
59A essentially seeks to provide more clearly the powers of the Minister
to make regulations in order to put into effect Malaysia's obligation to
extend copyright protection under the Act to "foreign works" under a
treaty or a Convention or Union relating to copyright should Malaysia
become a party to such a treaty or a member of such a Convention
or Union.

COPYRIGHT (AMENDMENT) 15

8. Clauses 3, 4, 5,10,11,15,17,18 and 22 generally seek to make
consequential amendments to the Act as well as to clarify or provide more
specifically certain provisions of the Act.

9. _Clause 9 seeks to amend subsection (2) of section 36 of the Act to_
make it an act of copyright infringement for a person to import any article
into Malaysia for the purposes enumerated in that subsection if the
importation is without the consent or licence of the copyright owner and
the importer knows or ought reasonably to know that the making of the
article was carried out without the consent or licence of the copyright
owner.

10. Clauses 12,13,14 and 16 seek to amend sections 44,46 (1), 48 and
54 of the Act respectively in order to generally enhance the powers of
enforcement under the Act.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure. -  [PN. (U[2]) 1095.]
