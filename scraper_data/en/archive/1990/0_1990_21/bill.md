EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Customs Act 1967 (hereinafter referred to as
"the Act").

_2. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act by creating three new_
definitions to explain their use in the various sections in the Act.

3. Clause 3 amends section 3 (3) of the Act to ensure that the relaxation
on the use of various forms allowed under section 145 of the Act is not
being misused.

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 17 of the Act to empower the Director
General to allow money due to be paid by a person liable, to be paid by
instalments in such amounts and on such dates as he may determine.

5. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 18 (I) of the Act to provide for the
circumstances whereby remission of customs duty in cases where goods
are lost, may be allowed only where such loss is on account of unavoidable
accident.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 44 (3) of the Act. The proposed
amendment is consequential to the amendment made to the Subordinate
Courts Act 1948 where the jurisdiction of a Magistrate is enhanced to
preside over all cases within the Act.

7. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 55 (2) to provide for an increased
penalty for any offence committed under this subsection. The proposed
amendment to section 55 (3) is for a similar purpose as in clause 6.

section 65D and section 65E. Section 65D gives the Director General power
to issue a licence to operate a duty free shop. Section 65E empowers the
Director General to issue a licence to operate an inland clearance depot.

subsection (5) to empower the Director General to allow the release of
certain imported goods instead of being deposited in warehouses, subject

of the amount secured, to the Director General if the court forfeits the
goods under section 128 (4) and to allow a senior officer of customs to sell
or destroy any goods seized which are dangerous in nature.
