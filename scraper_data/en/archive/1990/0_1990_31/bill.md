HOUSING AND AMENITIES

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to prescribe the minimum standards of housing and
nurseries for workers in a place of employment. It requires the
employer to provide also hospital and medical facilities as well as social
amenities. At present, the laws governing these matters are contained
in the Workers (Minimum Standards of Housing) Act 1966 and its regu-
lations, and the various Labour Codes. Generally, the provisions of the
existing laws are retained but some of the provisions have been
amended and new ones introduced to update and improve the minimum

standard requirements of the existing laws in order to cater for the needs,
interests and welfare of the workers,

PART I

2. Part I deals with preliminary matters.

3. Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement
of the Bill and its application throughout Malaysia.

4. Clause 2 limits the extent of the application and excludes any place of
employment or part thereof situated within the area of a City Council, a
Municipal Council or a Federal Territory from the operation of the Bill,

5. _Clause_ _3defines various expressions used in the Bill which, except for_

some new definitions, are basically derived from the existing laws. The
term "building" has been given a specific meaning to refer to any
building used for the housing of workers, and includes a nursery and
a community hall. The expression "estate" has been redefined so as to
widen the scope of coverage of the Bill; it now refers to any agricultural
land which exceeds twenty hectares in area and includes a mine and any
other place of employment as may be determined by the Minister.

6. Clause 4 seeks to provide for the Minister by order to exempt any
employer or building from the provisions of this Bill.

PART II

7. Part II contains general provisions regarding the requirements and
conditions to be observed by an employer in respect of any housing,
nursery or community hall built or provided under the provisions of this
Bill.

8. Clause 5 is a general provision that requires a house, nursery or
community hall to comply with the requirements of this Bill. It contains
a prohibition against the housing of workers in buildings which do not
comply with the requirements of the Bill. Existing buildings used for the
housing of workers may continue to be used provided they are modified
or converted to meet the said requirements. The Director General is


-----

26 BILL

however empowered to exempt any employer from this requirement
for a certain period of time or he may order the building to be so altered,
modified, replaced or demolished.

9. Clause 6 requires the employer to provide the workers with sufficient
supply of electricity and free and adequate piped water drawn from either
a public main or from any other source. Where the supply of electricity
is not practicable or viable the Director General is empowered to exempt
the employer from complying with this requirement. The Director
General may also approve any other means of water supply if the
provision to each house of piped water proves impracticable. Clause 6 also
requires the employer to maintain the buildings in good and satisfactory
condition and to demolish any unauthorized extension or structural
alteration.

10. Clause 7 seeks to provide for the approval of building plans for any

nursery or community hall by the relevant authorities.

11. Clause 8 seeks to provide for the inspection of any building, estate

hospital, clinic or place of employment by the Medical Officer of
Health and the District Engineer in order to detect any condition which
may endanger the health or safety of any person.

12. Clause 9 seeks to allow buildings originally built for a purpose other

than the housing of workers to be converted for the purpose of housing
workers upon approval by the Director General.

13. Clause 10 empowers the Director General to order the employer to

build and maintain a nursery at a place of employment where there are
more than ten dependants under four years of age living with the
workers. It also requires the employer to supply milk in sufficient quantity
and of good quality and play equipment. Under the proviso any
subsequent reduction in the number of dependants shall not invalidate
the order of the Director General.

14. Clause 11 seeks to provide for the allotment of land to workers for

purposes of cultivation and grazing.

15. Clause 12 empowers the Director General to order the employer to

build and maintain in a satisfactory condition a community hall and to
provide sporting facilities and other recreational facilities in a place of
employment where one hundred or more workers reside. Failure on the
part of the employer to comply with the order constitutes an offence.

16. Clause 13 provides that no rent or charge should be paid for any

housing, nursery, community hall, sports and recreational facilities, sani-
tation or allotment of land provided for workers under the Bill.

17. Part III contains provisions relating to estate hospitals and matters

connected therewith.

HOUSING AND AMENITIES

18. Clause 14 gives a new definition to the term "dependant" for the

purpose of Part III. Basically it seeks to confine the benefits of free

medical treatment to the worker's immediate family members including
his parents but it increases the qualifying age limit for dependent
children from 14 years to 18 years of age.

19. Clause 15 empowers the Director General to require the construction

of workers including diet at the estate hospital up to a period of one month
shall be borne by the employer. However expenses incurred in excess of
30 days during which such worker or his dependant shall remain in
the hospital may be recovered from the worker at a rate to be determined
by the Minister.

21. Clause 17 seeks to provide for the hospitalisation of a worker or any
of his dependants at a rate to be prescribed by the Minister. The expenses
shall be recoverable from the employer.

22. Clause 18 contains provisions relating to the responsibility of the

employer or resident manager to ensure that a sick worker or his sick
dependant gets immediate medical attention. In this respect the employer
or resident manager is obliged, at his own expense, to make arrangements
and provide safe transportation facilities to and from hospital for the sick
worker.

23. Clause 19 requires the employer to establish and maintain a clinic in
a place of employment where no estate or group estate hospital is
available. The employer shall ensure that a fortnightly supervision of the
operation and management of the clinic is carried out by a registered
medical practitioner and may not discontinue the maintenance and
operation of such clinic without the prior written consent of the Director
General.

24. Clause 20 makes it a duty for the resident registered medical practi-
tioner or the resident manager to immediately isolate any worker or other
person on an estate if such person is suspected of suffering from any
infectious disease. He shall then report accordingly to the nearest Medical
Officer.

25. Clause 21 deals with a situation where an infectious disease has
occurred on any estate. In such a case it shall be the duty of the employer,
if so directed by the Medical Officer, to segregate such sick person in the

interest of public health.

Part III to be upon the person who alleges that he is not the employer,
resident manager or other person.
