EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Medicines (Advertisement and Sale)
Act 1956 (after this referred to as the "Act").

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act to insert into the

definition of "advertisement" the words "report, commentary" so
as to make it clear that they are within the ambit of such definition.

This clause also seeks to amend the definition of "authorized

officer" by deleting the word "registered" which qualifies
"pharmacist" in that definition. The term "registered pharmacist"
at the moment means a pharmacist registered under the
Registration of Pharmacists Ordinance 1951, which is applicable
only in West Malaysia. A pharmacist in the public service in Sabah
or Sarawak therefore may not be appointed as an authorized
officer under the Act. This amendment will remedy that situation.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 3 of the Act so that the

prohibition in that section does not only extend to advertisements
calculated to lead to the use of any article as a medicine but also to
advertisements calculated to lead to the use of any article as an
appliance or remedy for, inter alia, the prevention or treatment of
diseases.

_Clause 3 also seeks to add a new paragraph (d) to subsection (1)_

of section 3 to prohibit advertisement calculated to lead to the use
of any article for the purpose of diagnosing diseases specified in
the Schedule to the Act.

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4A of the Act to make the
prohibition in that section clearer and to extend the prohibition to
advertisements referring to any skill or service relating to the

(AMENDMENT)

_prevention and diagnosis of any ailment, disease, injury, infirmity_
or condition affecting the human body. At the moment it only
extends to the treatment of such ailment, disease, injury, infirmity
or condition. This would enable advertisements relating to
radiological services and clinical analyses to be controlled.

This clause also seeks to allow hospitals registered under the

Private Hospitals Act 1971 as well as private medical clinics,
private radiological clinics and private medical laboratories to
advertise their skills or services subject to certain conditions.

5. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 6B of the Act to empower an
authorized officer who is investigating the commission of an
offence under this Act to order any person who appears to be
acquainted with the circumstances of the case to attend before
such officer for the purpose of an examination under the Act. The
object of this amendment is to facilitate such investigation.

6- Clause 8 seeks to amend subsection (2) of section 6F of the Act
to enable any authorized officer to conduct prosecutions in respect
of offences under the Act. At present only a registered pharmacist
in the public service who is authorized in writing by the Public
Prosecutor may conduct such prosecutions.

7. Other amendments are minor or consequential in nature only.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1318.]
