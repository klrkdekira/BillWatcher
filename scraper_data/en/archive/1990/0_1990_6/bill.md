transitional period, and its continuation thereafter, if
any, are hereby declared lawful and valid, and shall be
deemed to be, and to have always and at all times been,
lawful and valid, notwithstanding that the period for
which it was directed by that order that such person be
detained commenced from a date other than the date
on which the detention order was made.

(2) No action, suit, prosecution, or other legal
proceeding whatsoever of any description or in any

order or the detention declared lawful and valid under
subsection (1), save that the provisions of this
subsection shall not apply to any such legal proceeding
which had concluded and the final decision in respect of

Act, or to any appeal in respect of such final decision.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill is enacted under Article 149 of the Federal Constitution
to amend the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act
1985 (which is referred to in this Statement as the "Act").

2. Subsection (1) of section 6 of the Act empowers the Minister
to make a detention order directing a person to be detained for a
period not exceeding two years from the date of such order. Clause
_2 of the Bill seeks to amend that subsection to remove the words_
"from the date of such order" so as to bring it in line with other
similar laws.

3. Clause 3 (I) seeks to validate any detention order made, and
any detention effected in pursuance of that order, after the
commencement of the Act but before the commencement of the
proposed amendment where such detention order commenced
from a date other than the date on which it was made.

DANGEROUS DRUGS (SPECIAL PREVENTIVE 3
MEASURES) (AMENDMENT)

_Clause 3 (2) seeks to prohibit any action, suit, prosecution or_
any other legal proceeding from being brought, instituted or
maintained in respect of any detention order or detention
validated under clause 3 (1). This prohibition, however, does not
apply to any legal proceeding where the court has given its final
decision before the commencement of this Bill, or where there is
an appeal in respect of such decision.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (IP) 1604.]
