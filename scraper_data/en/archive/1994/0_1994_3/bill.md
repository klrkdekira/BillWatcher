company, to make financial arrangements for that company and to
provide for matters relating to staff.

BILL

2. Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title and commencement
date while clause 2 seeks to provide for matters relating to
interpretation.

3. Clause 3 seeks to provide that, on a vesting date to be
appointed by the Minister by order published in the Gazette, all
property, rights and liabilities of the Lembaga Padi dan Beras
Negara that are specified in the order, are to be transferred to and
vested in the successor company as if they were the property, rights
and liabilities of the successor company.

However, for the avoidance of doubt, subclause 3(8) seeks to
provide that the transfer to and the vesting of rights in the successor
company does not include the transfer and vesting of the right of
the Government to regulate matters on padi and rice. Neither does
it confer any exclusive and perpetual right on that company to
import and export rice nor other exclusive and perpetual rights on
matters relating to padi and rice.

4. Clause 4 seeks to provide for the securities of the successor
company to be issued or allotted to the Corporation, that is, the

person who was given an option by the Lembaga Padi dan Beras
Negara and who opts to serve as an employee of the successor
company shall be employed by such company on terms and
conditions of service not less favourable than those to which he
was entitled to immediately before the appointed date.

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1776.]
