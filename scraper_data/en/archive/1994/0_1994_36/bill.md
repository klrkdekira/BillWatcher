COURTS OF JUDICATURE (AMENDMENT) (No. 2) 5

17. Any proceeding which is pending before the
Supreme Court on the 23rd June 1994 shall be continued
or proceeded with, as the case may be, before the
Federal Court and for this purpose the Federal Court
shall have and exercise all the powers of the Supreme
Court prior to 24th June 1994.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to introduce some amendments to the Courts of
Judicature Act 1964 ("the Act").

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 50 of the Act to include in
the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal the power to hear and
determine any appeal against any decision made by the High Court
in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. This clause also seeks
to provide that any appeal on a question of law to the Court of
Appeal from the decision of a Magistrate's Court must be a
question of law which has arisen in the course of the appeal or
revision and that the determination of such question by the High
Court had affected the event of the appeal or revision. This clause
further seeks to impose a time limit for obtaining leave from the
Court of Appeal. Clause 3 seeks to amplify the operation of this
time limit.

3. Clause 4 seeks to delete the proviso to subsection 52(1) of the
Act.

4. Clauses 5 and 6 seek to amend subsections 53(2) and 57(1) of
the Act to substitute the words "trial Court" with the words "High
Court" in order to make it clear that the Court concerned is the
High Court and not any court subordinate thereto.

5. Clause 7 inter alia seeks to amend subsection 60(2) of the Act
for the same reason given for clauses 5 and 6. It is consequential
upon the proposed amendment to section 50 of the Act.

6. Clause 8 seeks to amend subsection 61(3) of the Act
consequential upon the abolition of trials by jury.

7. Clause 9 seeks to amend section 63 of the Act consequential
upon the proposed amendments to section 50 of the Act.

8. Clause 10 seeks to delete section 65 of the Act.

9. Clause 11 seeks to delete section 66 of the Act consequential
upon the proposed amendments to subsection 50(2) of the Act.


Saving and
transitional.


-----

6 BILL

10. Clause 12 seeks to make consequential amendments to
subsection 67(1) of the Act.

11. Clauses 13 and 15 seek to amend sections 92 and 95
respectively of the Act in order to remove possible ambiguity in
the reference to "trial court" arising from the introduction of the
Court of Appeal. It is also consequential to the proposed
amendment to section 50 of the Act.

12. Clause 14 seeks to amend section 93 of the Act in order also
to remove possible ambiguity in the reference to "trial court" and
also to delete reference to jury and assessors consequential upon
the abolition of trials by jury.

13. Clause 16 seeks to amend section 96 of the Act to enable
appeals on certain matters to be made without having to have regard
for the monetary value of the claim concerned. This is necessary
because the particularisation of the existing paragraph (a) of section
96 of the Act no longer allows appeals from decisions in certain
civil matters, in particular matters concerning judicial review of
administrative actions which ordinarily cannot be given monetary
value, to be brought before the Federal Court.

14. _Clause 17 provides for saving and transitional provisions to_
enable proceedings pending before the Supreme Court on the 23rd
June 1994 to be proceeded before the Pederal Court.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1859.]
