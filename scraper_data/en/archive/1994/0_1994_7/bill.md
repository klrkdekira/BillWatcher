EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Road Transport Act 1987, hereinafter
referred to as "the Act".

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 3A of the Act to enable the

provisions of that section to be extended to any city, including a
city in East Malaysia.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 16 of the Act consequent to
the change in Government policy as regards the issuance of motor
vehicle licences.

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 17 of the Act by deleting
subsection (1A). This amendment is pursuant to the Government's

current policy not to link the issuance of a motor vehicle licence
with an inspection certificate.

5. Clause 5 seeks to correct subsection 20(2) of the national
language text.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 59 of the Act to enable an
inspection to be carried out by a person licensed to carry out
inspection. At the moment the inspection may only be carried out
by a road transport officer.

7. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 60 to enable an inspection
under that section to be carried out by a person licensed to carry
out inspection. Under the existing section 60, only a police officer
and a road transport officer may conduct the inspection. This
amendment also enables a prohibition order to be issued by a road
transport officer in respect of vehicles with serious defects as is
the case under section 59 of the Act.


-----

12 BILL

8. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 61 to enable an inspection
under that section to be carried out by a person licensed to carry
out inspection. In addition, the expenses incurred in respect of that
inspection shall be borne by the owner.

9. Clause 9 seeks to amend section 63 to enable the weighing of
vehicles to be carried out by a person authorised to carry out

weighing, which may include a person licensed to carry out
inspection under the Act.

10. Clause 10 seeks to introduce a new Part 11A on periodic

inspection of motor vehicles. The new section 66A prohibits the
use of prescribed classes or categories of vehicles without there

being in force inspection certificates in respect of the vehicles. The
new section 66B empowers the Minister to specify the class or
category of vehicles required to undergo periodic inspection and
the frequency of such inspection. Section 66c provides that if upon
inspection a motor vehicle is found to comply with the requirements
as to construction, equipment and use, an inspection certificate shall
be issued. If an inspection certificate is refused, the aggrieved
person may appeal to the Director General who shall cause the
vehicle to be re-inspected. Section 66D requires an inspection
certificate to be displayed. Section 66E makes it an offence for a
person, other than a person licensed, to carry out inspection.

Section 66F requires the person licensed to carry out inspection to
employ persons with the requisite qualification and competency as
examiners to carry out inspection. Section 66G empowers the
Minister to make rules for the purpose of carrying this Part 11A into
effect.

11. Clause 11 seeks to make various amendments to section 117

so that a certificate issued by a person licensed under the Act shall
be admissible in evidence.

12. Clause 12 seeks to introduce a new section 119A which

provides for offences committed by a body corporate.

13. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 126 to make it clear that_

the Minister has power to authorise or grant a licence to any person
to undertake any function of a road transport officer under the Act
notwithstanding anything contained therein. In addition, the
Minister is empowered to make rules relating to the authorisation
or licence. It also seeks to make further provisions in section 126
relating to the collection and retention of charges, fees or levy by
the person authorised or licensed and the maintenance of accounts,
books and records by such person. It also seeks to stipulate that
the Federal Government shall not be Hable in respect of any injury,
damage or loss resulting from the failure of the person authorised
or licensed to carry out his obligations under the Act.


-----

**ROAD TRANSPORT (AMENDMENT)** 13

14. Clause 14 seeks to introduce a new section 126A to empower
the Minister to revoke any authorisation or licence issued under
section 126.

_FINANC/AL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

expenditure.
