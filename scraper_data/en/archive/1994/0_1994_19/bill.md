**EXPLANATORY STATEMENT**

This Bill seeks to amend the Statutory and Local Authorities
Pensions Act 1980 ("the Act").

2. Clause 4 seeks to introduce three new sections, namely, section

6B, 6C and 6D into the Act. The proposed section 6B enables a
pensionable employee of a statutory or local authority to surrender
voluntarily his pensions rights by opting for the Employees
Provident Fund Scheme. The option exercised by the employee
under this provision must be made to the appropriate appointing
authority in a manner approved by the pensions authority and is
irrevocable.

Under the proposed section 6C, a statutory or local authority is

required to make retrospective contributions to the Employees
Provident Fund in respect of each pensionable employee who has
opted for the Employees Provident Fund Scheme. The contributions
are for the period commencing from the date the employee became
a pensionable employee and ending on the date he ceases to be a
pensionable employee under section 6B.

Under the proposed section 6D, a statutory or local authority is

allowed to offer to its pensionable employees an option to opt for
the Employees Provident Fund Scheme.

3. Clause 5 seeks to validate any offer which may have been made
before the coming into force of the proposed Act to employees of
any statutory or local authority to opt for the Employees Provident
Fund Scheme, and to validate any option made by such employee
who opted for that Scheme.

**_FINANCIAL_** **_IMPLICATIONS_**

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure
the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN. (U[2]) 1795.]
