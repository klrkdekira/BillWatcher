The new subsection (4B) expressly prohibits the fund from being
utilised to pay any claims of its director, controller. associate or
subsidiary or the associate or subsidiary of a body corporate ot"
which the insolvent insurer is a subsidiary. Further, a claim will
only be paid if the liquidator is notified of the liability within six

4. Clause 3 seeks to introduce two new provisions. The new section
12B provides for the Director General. with the approval of the
Minister, to borrow moneys for an insurance guarantee scheme fund
on such terms and conditions as may be approved by the Minister.
The new section 12c empowers the Director General to pay claimants
up front upon assignment of the claimant's rights to the claim and
upon the claimant's acceptance of the amount paid as full and final
settlement of the claim. This early payment by the fund will reduce
the hardship to claimants.


-----

5 Clause 4 seeks to introduce four new sections into the Act,
namely, sections 29A to 29D. These new provisions are necessary
to enable the Director General to supervise the !iquidator and to
monitor the liquidation of an insurer.

The new section 29A seeks to provide for the application of
sections 29A and 29B to existing liquidations of insurers, that is,
to First General Insurance Bhd. and SEG Insurance Sdn. Bhd. whose
liquidations have commenced but have not yet been completed.

The new section 29B provides that subject to an order of the
Court, a liquidator other than the Official Receiver shall carry out
his functions under the direction and supervision of the Director

a specified person to assist the liquidator in the winding up of an
insolvent insurer.

The new section 29c provides that a Iiquidator is required to
lodge with the Director General the preiiminary report and the
prescribed form which are required to be lodged by him with the
Court and the Official Receiver respectively. It also empowers the
Director General to require the submission of such other reports.
accounts and statements as he may specify.

The new section 29D provides that all policies issued by an insurer
that is being wound up shall be terminated with effect from the date
of the winding up order. The provision is necessary to protect the
interest of policy owners and their claimants because an insurer in
liquidation is in no position to provide insurance protection or lo
pay any claims adequately.

expenditure. [PN. (U2) 1841.]
