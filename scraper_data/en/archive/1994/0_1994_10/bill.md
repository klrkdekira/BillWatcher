BILL

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Election Offences Act 1954 ("the
Act").

2. Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to correct translation errors in the
national language text of the Act.

3. _Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend subsection 14(1) of the_
Act to require the election agent to inform the presiding officer and
the returning officer the name and address of the counting agent
under the supervision of the relevant officers. This amendment is
in consequence of the provisions contained in the Elections (Conduct
of Elections) Regulations 1981. This clause also seeks to make it
clear that in relation to the returning officer, counting agent means
the counting agent for postal votes. It also seeks to substitute the
proviso. The proposed new proviso empowers the presiding officer
and the returning officer to limit the number of counting agents for
each candidate.

_FINANClAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra expenditure.

[PN. (U[2]) 1663.]
