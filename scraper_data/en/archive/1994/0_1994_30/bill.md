the funds to the Corporation which shall not be

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Probate and Administration Act 1959,
hereinafter referred to as "the Act", consequent upon the introduction
of a new law by which a company by the name of Amanah Raya
Berhad assumes the role of the Public Trustee and Official Administrator.


Amendment
of section 86


-----

PROBATE AND ADMINISTRATION (AMENDMENT) 3

2. _Clause 2 seeks to delete the definition of "Official Administrator"_
since the functions and po wers of the Official Administrator under the
Act have been taken over by the Corporation. It also seeks to define
the Corporation as being a company incorporated under the Companies
Act 1965 under the name of Amanah Raya Berhad. It further seeks to
make consequential amendments to the definition of "trust corporation" so that there will be no reference to the Official Administrator
and Public Trustee.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to make consequential amendments to various_
sections by substituting for the words "Official Administrator" the
word "Corporation".

4. _Clause 4 seeks to delete various sections as a consequence of the_
transfer of functions and powers of the Official Administrator to the
Corporation.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 86 of the Act to enable the_
Corporation to accept funds which a personal representative has not
been able todispose of immediately by distribution upon the conclusion
of the administration of the estate of a person dying testate or intestate.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[:]) 1830.]
