18 BILL

the Lord President of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice of a High
Court and the High Court in Borneo with the references to the
Federal Court, the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, the Chief
Judge of a High Court and the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak
respectively.

2. Clause 4 of this Bill seeks to introduce a new Clause (1A) into
Article 40 of the Constitution. Under the new Clause, if the
Yang di-Pertuan Agong is required by the Constitution or federal
law to act in accordance with advice, on advice or after considering
advice, he shall accept and act in accordance with that advice.

3. _Clause 8 of this Bill seeks to amend Article 66 of the_
Constitution to replace the provisions of Clauses (4) and (4A). The
existing provisions in Clauses (4) and (4A) stipulate a procedure
whereby the Yang di-Pertuan Agong after a Bill is presented to him
for assent could within thirty days return the Bill to the House in
which it originated in order for the Bill to be reconsidered by
both Houses of Parliament and then presented again to the
Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The substituted Clauses (4) and (4A) instead
provide that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong has to assent to a Bill within
a period of thirty days after it is presented to him. If he does not do
so, the Bill will become law upon the expiration of that period as if
he had assented to it.

4. Clause 13 of this Bill introduces a new Clause (1B) into Article
121 of the Constitution. The new Clause contains provisions relating
to the establishment of a Court of Appeal.

5. _Clause 15 of this Bill seeks to introduce a new Article dealing_
with the constitution and jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. To
enable this Article to be inserted in the most appropriate place in the
Constitution, it is proposed that the existing Article 122A be
redrafted so that the new Article becomes Article 122A while the
provisions which relate to the constitution of the High Courts in the
existing Article 122A become Article 122AA. It is also proposed that
provisions relating to judicial commissioners be placed in a separate
Article, namely, Article 122AB, for ease of reference and to facilitate
future amendments, should such amendments become necessary. A
new Clause (2) is also introduced into the proposed Article 122AB to
require a judicial commissioner to take and subscribe the oath of
office and allegiance before exercising his judicial functions. At the
moment, under Article 124, such requirement applies only to judges.
_Clause 16 contains the new Articles 122AA and 122AB._

6. Clause 21 of this Bill seeks to introduce new Clauses (3A) and
(10) into Article 125.

Under the new Clause (3A) the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is
empowered to prescribe a code of ethics to be observed by judges.


-----

**CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT)** **19**

Any breach of any provision of such code will, in accordance with
the amendment proposed to Clause (3), be a ground for the removal
of a judge from office.

Under the new Clause (10), the President of the Court of Appeal

and the Chief Judges of the High Courts are made responsible to the
Chief Justice.

7. Clause 28 of this Bill seeks to amend Article 132 of the
