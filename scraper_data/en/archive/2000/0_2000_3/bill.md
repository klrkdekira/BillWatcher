EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to bring about uniformity of law and procedure in matters
relating to the discipline of, and the imposition of surcharge on, officers of
federal statutory bodies.

2. Part I of the Bill deals with preliminary matters.

_Clause 1 contains the short title and the date of commencement of the_
proposed Act.

_Clause 2 deals with the scope of the proposed Act. The proposed Act will_
not apply to statutory bodies whose remuneration schemes have been segregated.

_Clause 3 sets out the relationship between the proposed Act and the federal_
law by which a statutory body is incorporated.

_Clause 4 contains the definitions of certain terms used in the Bill._

3. Part II of the Bill deals with matters relating to discipline.

_Clause 5 provides that the Regulations set out in the Second Schedule are_
'

.â¢ applicable in respect of the discipline of officers of all statutory bodies.

f

~. 4. Part III of the Bill contains provisions on the termination in the public

~
t interest of the service of an officer of a statutory body.
I.
!

_Clauses 9 and 10 seek to empower a statutory body to terminate the service_
of an officer of the statutory body if, having regard to the conditions of service,
the work, the conduct and the usefulness of the officer, the statutory body is
satisfied that it is desirable that the service of that officer be terminated in the
public interest. Clause 12 provides that such termination is not dismissal.

_Clause 11 requires the statutory body to give the officer whose service it_
proposes to terminate in the public interest an opportunity to be heard.


-----

5. Part IV of the Bill provides for the imposition of surcharge on the officers
and former officers of a statutory body.

_Clause 14 sets out the grounds for the impositIOn of a surcharge while_
_clause 16 provides for the imposition of the surcharge. The manner in which_
such surcharge is to be recovered is specified in clause 20.

_Clause 19 requires every surcharge imposed on an officer to be recorded in_
his Records of Service. The imposition of a surcharge on an officer does not
prevent the institution of any disciplinary action against him. This is provided
for in clause 22.

The officer to be surcharged must be given an opportunity to be heard and
must be notified in writing of a decision to impose a surcharge on him. These
are provided for in clauses 15 and 17.

_Clause 18 permits the withdrawal of a surcharge._

Under clause 21, if any action for surcharge is to be taken against the
Director General of a statutory body, the composition of the Board or statutory
body for the purpose of that action must not include the Director General.

6. Part V of the Bill contains the powers of the Prime Minister and the
powers of the Minister in relation.to the statutory body for which he is responsible.

_Clause 23 empowers the Prime Minister to amend the Schedules._

_Clauses 24 and 25 empower the Minister to issue directives to a statutory_
body for the purpose of ensuring that the statutory body complies with the
provisions of the proposed Act and, with the concurrence of the Prime Minister,
to exempt any statutory body from any provision of the Second or Third
Schedule or to vary any provision in the Second or Third Schedule in its
application to a statutory body.

7. Part VI of the Bill contains clause 26, which extends the protection in the
Public Authorities Protection Act 1948 [Act 198] to a statutory body and its
members, officers, servants and agents, and clause 27, which allows a statutory
body to issue Mministrative directives in relation to the conduct and discipline
of its officers and the procedure for the imposition of surcharge.

8. Part VII of the Bill provides for the cessation of certain provisions of the
incorporating law of a statutory body and saving and transitional matters.

_Clause 28 provides that the provisions in the incorporating law of a statutory_
body on discipline, termination in the public interest and surcharge cease to
apply to the statutory body upon the commencement of the proposed Act.

_Clause 29 provides that any disciplinary proceedings pending before the_


-----

_Statutory Bodies (Discipline And_ 51
_Surcharge)_

Act must be continued in accordance with the provisions of that law. However,
where a disciplinary offence was committed before the commencement of the

, proposed Act, the officer concerned may choose to have the matter dealt with
under the incorporating law or the proposed Act.
