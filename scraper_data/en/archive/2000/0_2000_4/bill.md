EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Sale of Drugs Act 1952 ("Act 368") to extend
the scope of Act 368 to any substance, product or article intended to be used
or capable of being used on animals, and to increase the penalties provided
for in Act 368.

2. To achieve the purpose of extending the scope of Act 368 to any substance,
product or article intended to be used or capable of being used on animals,
it is proposed, in clause 2, that the definition of "drug" in section 2 of Act
368 be amended, and that a new definition, that is "medicinal purpose", be
added to that section. It also proposed, in clause 6, that section 17 of Act 368
be amended to include a reference to animal consumption or use. At the moment,
section 17 refers to human consumption or use only.

3. To achieve the purpose of increasing the penalties under Act 368, it is
proposed, in clause 5, that section 12 of Act 368 be amended so that the
general penalty for an individual offender is increased from a fine of five
hundred ringgit to a maximum fine of twenty-five thousand ringgit or
imprisonment for a maximum term of three years or to both for a first offence,
and a maximum fine of fifty thousand ringgit or imprisonment for a maximum
term of five years for a second or subsequent offence. For a body corporate,
it is proposed that the quantum of the maximum fines be doubled.

_4._ _Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to repeal subsection 10(4) of Act 368 which_
contains the penalty for the contravention of that section. With this repeal, the
general penalty proposed in clause 5 shall apply to offences against section
10.

5. Another proposal for the purpose of increasing penalties under Act 368
is contained in clause 8. It is proposed that the penalty for the contravention
of regulations made under Act 368 be increased from a fine of one thousand
ringgit to a fine not exceeding fifty thousand ringgit or im~risonment for a
term not exceeding five years or both.

6.. Other amendments proposed in this Bill, namely in clauses 3 and 7 and
in paragraph 2(a), are amendments to correct minor printing errors in Act 368.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
