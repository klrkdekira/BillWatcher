**Forfeiture of property upon prosecution for an offence**

**416L.** Subject to section 416M, in any prosecution for an
offence relating to an organized criminal group, the court
shall make an order for the forfeiture of any property which
is proved to be illegal property where the offence is not
proved against the accused but the court is satisfied—

_(a)_ that the accused is not the true and lawful owner of
such property; and

_(b)_ that no other person is entitled to the property as a
purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration.

**_Bona fide third parties_**

**416M.** (1) The Court making the order of forfeiture under
section 416K or 416L shall cause to be published a notice
in the _Gazette_ calling upon any third party who claims to
have interest in the property to attend before the Court on
the date specified in the notice to show cause as to why
the property shall not be forfeited.


-----

_Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)_ 21

(2) A third party’s lack of good faith may be inferred, by
the Court from the objective circumstances of the case.

(3) The Court shall return the property to the claimant
when it is satisfied that—

_(a)_ the claimant has a legitimate legal interest in the
property;

_(b)_ no participation, collusion or involvement with respect
to the offence relating to an organized criminal
group can be imputed to the claimant;

_(c)_ the claimant lacked knowledge and was not intentionally
ignorant of the illegal use of the property, or if he
had knowledge, did not freely consent to its illegal
use;

_(d)_ the claimant did not acquire any right in the property
from a person proceeded against under circumstances
that give rise to a reasonable inference that any right
was transferred for the purpose of avoiding the eventual
subsequent forfeiture of the property; and

_(e)_ the claimant did all that could reasonably be expected
to prevent the illegal use of the property.

**Presumption as to illegal property**

**416N.** Where any proceedings under this Chapter are brought
against any person in respect of any property seized on
the ground that such property is illegal property, the Court
shall presume such property seized under this Chapter to
be illegal property unless the person whose property was
seized proves to the contrary by admissible evidence and
where he adduces any such evidence, the Public Prosecutor
shall have the right to rebut the same.

**Admissibility of documentary and other evidence obtained**
**in the course of a seizure under this Chapter**

**416O.** Where the Public Prosecutor or a police officer has
obtained any document or other evidence in the course of
a seizure under this Chapter, such document or copy of


-----

22 _Bill_

the document or other evidence, as the case may be, shall
be admissible in evidence in any proceedings under this
Chapter, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any
written law.”.

**New section 425A**

**16.** The Code is amended by inserting after section 425 the
following section:

“Trial in absence of an accused

**425A.** (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Code, if an accused person absconds during the course of
his trial, the accused shall be deemed to have waived his
right to be present at the trial.

(2) A Court may proceed or continue with the trial and
pass a judgment in the absence of the accused.

(3) If a warrant of arrest has been issued—

_(a) the Court may adjourn the trial and await the_
appearance of the accused or await the execution
of the warrant; or

_(b) if the Court is satisfied that it is no longer in the_
interests of justice to await the appearance of the
accused or to await the execution of the warrant,
the Court may, at any time, proceed or continue
with the trial.

(4) If the Court proceeds or continues with the trial pursuant
to subsection (2), the Court may draw an inference adverse
to the accused from the fact that he has absconded.

(5) If an accused reappears at his trial, he is not entitled
to have any part of the proceeding that was conducted in
his absence re-opened unless the Court is satisfied that
because of exceptional circumstances it is in the interests
of justice to re-open the proceedings.

(6) Where an accused has absconded and the Court
proceeds or continues with his trial, counsel for the accused
may continue to act for the accused in the trial.”.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (“Act 593”) and the
Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2012 (“Act A1431”).

2. In line with the amendments proposed to several other laws with regard
to organized crime and other consequential matters, several amendments have
been proposed to the Criminal Procedure Code (“the Code”).

3. The Code is proposed to be amended by inserting a provision which
provides that any offence under the Penal Code is a seizable offence if it is
expressly provided under any other written law that such offence is a seizable
offence.

4. Section 13 is proposed to be amended to allow the public to give information
to the police about the commission or the intention of any other person to
commit any offence punishable under the Penal Code or under any written
law in a move to curb the rampant rise of crimes.

5. The Code is also proposed to be amended by introducing a provision
empowering the Public Prosecutor to appear in any application made under
section 98 of the Code.

_Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)_ 39

6. Similar to the amendment proposed to section 98 of the Code, section 117
of the Code is also proposed to be amended to allow the Public Prosecutor to be
present during an application to remand an accused person if the investigation
cannot be completed within twenty-four hours. Section 117 of the Code is
proposed to be amended further by introducing a provision empowering the
Magistrate to authorize the detention of an accused person in custody for 14
days if such person is being detained for investigation in relation to organized
crime.

If the offence being investigated involving two or more accused persons is
punishable with imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than ten
years, a provision is proposed to be introduced into section 117 authorizing
the Magistrate to detain an accused person in custody for a period of seven
days on the first application and seven days on the second application.

7. Section 173A of the Code is proposed to be amended by introducing a
provision whereby any person charged with an offence for which a minimum
penalty is imposed shall not be allowed to be discharged either conditionally
or unconditionally. A similar amendment is proposed in section 294 of the
Code whereby if a first-time offender is charged with an offence which carries
a minimum penalty, he shall not be released on a bond of good behavior.

8. To address the issue of witnesses refusing to appear to testify for fear that
his safety may be compromised if his identity is disclosed, it is proposed that
the evidence of such witnesses is allowed to be taken in such a manner that
they are not to be seen or heard by both the accused and his counsel. The
proposed amendments also allow that the witness’ voice could be distorted
if the witness feels that his voice may be recognized. For that purpose
sections 265A, 265B and 265C are proposed to be introduced into the Code.

9. Section 282 of the Code is proposed to be amended by introducing a
provision whereby the Court shall not pronounce concurrent sentences when
a person is convicted at one trial for two or more offences.

10. A new section 386A is proposed to be introduced into the Code to
disallow bail from being granted to any person who is a member of an
organized criminal group who is charged with a serious offence. Similarly if
any person who is a member of an organized criminal group is charged with
a non-serious offence, he shall not be granted bail upon the issuance of a
certificate by the Public Prosecutor.

11. A new section 399B is proposed to be introduced into the Code allowing
evidence or report given by an expert on the activities, structure, ritual,
ceremonies, hand sign, insignia, characteristic or any other matters relating
to an organized criminal group to be admitted as evidence.

12. Section 407 of the Code is proposed to be amended by introducing a
provision ordering an accused person whose case has been proved to pay
a penalty where a property impounded has been disposed of or cannot be
traced.

40 _Bill_

13. Section 414 of the Code is proposed to be amended allowing unclaimed
seized property to be sold by the Officer in charge of a Police District instead
of a Chief Police Officer.

14. Section 415 of the Code is proposed to be amended to allow any property
which is perishable or of small value detained in police custody on the order
of a Magistrate or seized by the police under Chapter XLIA to be sold by
public auction.

15. A new Chapter XLIA is proposed to be introduced into the Code with
regard to seizure and forfeiture of property and its derivatives belonging to
organized criminal group which were obtained in the commission of an offence
or which will lead to the commission of an offence. Seizure of businesses of
organized criminal group is also proposed to be introduced into this Chapter.
Any property seized under this Chapter shall be presumed to be illegal property
unless the person whose property has been seized is able to prove to the
contrary.

The procedural provisions were adopted with modifications from the
Dangerous Drugs (Forfeiture of Property) Act 1988 [Act 340] and the
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001 [Act 613].
A distinct feature proposed to be introduced into the Code is a presumption
provision presuming that such property seized and forfeited is illegal property
unless proven otherwise. Such seizure and forfeiture may be effected where
there is prosecution or no prosecution for an offence. The right of a bona fide
third party relating to the seized and forfeited property is addressed whereby
a notice will be published in the _Gazette calling upon any_ _bona fide third_
party who claims to have an interest in the property seized to show to the
Court why the property shall not be forfeited.

16. A new section 425A is proposed to be introduced into the Code to provide
for the procedure in instances where an accused person absconds during his
trial. Under this new proposed amendment the Court is allowed to proceed
with the trial and dispose of a case in the absence of an accused person who
absconds.

By this proposed amendment the accused person who absconds is deemed
to have waived his right to be present during his trial and may not later apply
to have the part of the trial conducted in his absence to be re-opened, unless
he is able to satisfy the Court that exceptional circumstances in the interest
of justice exist to do so.

17. Section 430 of the Code is proposed to be amended to increase the
reward, to a person who shows unusual courage in keeping public order, from
not more than one hundred ringgit to not less than one thousand ringgit and
not more than ten thousand ringgit. This provision is also proposed to be
amended to give the discretion to the Minister to award the reward instead
of Court.

18. With the introduction of new offences into the Penal Code, the First Schedule
of the Code also needs to be amended to include such new offences.


-----

_Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)_ 41

19. The provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2012

[Act A1413] in relation to Electronic Monitoring Device (EMD) are proposed
to be amended to introduce a form to be signed by an accused person ordered
by Court to be attached with an EMD to ensure that he is subject to the terms
and conditions stated in the form, failing which an amendment is proposed to
make it an offence with the punishment of not less than two years and not
more than ten years imprisonment. The proposed form is similar to the form
in the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 [Act 747].

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
