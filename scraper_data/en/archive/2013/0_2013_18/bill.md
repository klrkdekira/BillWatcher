EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend and extend the Prevention of Crime Act 1959
(“Act 297”).

2. _Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title of the proposed Act._

3. In order to allow the introduction of detention without criminal charge
or trial as previously provided in the repealed Emergency (Public Order and
Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969 [Ordinance 5, 1969, P.U. (A) 187/1969]
and the Internal Security Act 1960 [Act 82], Act 297 is to be changed to a law
made pursuant to Article 149 of the Federal Constitution, and its application
extended throughout Malaysia. The other provisions in Act 297 are also
amended to enhance the inquiry process to determine whether a person should
be subject to registration and supervision under Act 297.

4. _Clause 6_ seeks to amend section 4 of Act 297. The new subsection 4(1)
provides that the provisions of section 117 of the Criminal Procedure Code
shall apply for the remand of persons arrested under section 3 of Act 297 for
the purpose of investigation. Subsection 4(2) is amended to confer the power
to order the remand of a person in custody for the purpose of an inquiry under
Act 297 on a Sessions Court Judge as the offences under inquiry have been
categorized as serious offences. Consequent thereto, section 5 is deleted to
remove the power to order the extension of the remand.

5. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 7 of Act 297 by inserting new_
subsections (2) to (4) to provide for the use of electronic monitoring
devices on persons remanded in custody who are released pending the
inquiry.

6. _Clause 10 seeks to introduce a new section 7a into Act 297 to_
prescribe the procedures relating to the attachment of the electronic monitoring
device on a remanded person upon his release under paragraph 7(1)(b) of
Act 297.


-----

_Prevention of Crime (Amendment and Extension)_ 21

7. _Clause 11 seeks to introduce new sections 7b and 7c into Act 297 to provide_
for the establishment of the Prevention of Crime Board and its powers.

8. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 9 of Act 297 to provide that reports_
are to be made to the Prevention of Crime Board in place of the Minister.
The amendment to paragraph 9(3)(d) and the proviso to this paragraph seek
to empower the Inquiry Officer to receive evidence in the absence of the
person who is the subject of the inquiry if he considers it necessary in the
public interest or to protect a witness, or his family or associates. The new
subsection 9(5) seeks to provide that the person who is the subject of the
