**15b.** (1) Subject to Part III and this Part, pensions and

this Act shall be adjusted annually by an increment of
two percent in accordance with the provisions of this Act
and shall be paid or be payable with effect from January of

of the specified rate of increment would result in a situation
that is less favourable to a Judge appointed before the coming
into operation of this section, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong
may, by order in the Gazette, prescribe an appropriate higher
percentage to be applied in such case.

(3) For the purpose of an order under subsection (2), the
Yang di-Pertuan Agong may prescribe—

(6) Where the factor referred to in subsection (5) changes
according to the eligibility of the dependant as specified under
that Part, the dependant’s pension shall be adjusted based
on the notional salary as determined under subsection (7)
using the new factor applicable under that Part.

(7) The notional salary—

_(a) in the case of a dependant who received the dependant’s_

pension before or on 1 January 2014, shall be the
amount of the corresponding last drawn salary

annually up to the year when the factor changes;
or

_(b) in the case of a dependant who received the dependant’s_

amount of the last drawn salary received by a Judge
on the date of his death which has been calculated
with an increment of two percent annually up to
the year when the factor changes.

prescribed under subsection (2), the increment specified
under subsections (3), (4) and (5) shall be calculated using
that prescribed higher percentage.

subsection (6) shall be used as the basis for adjustments
under subsection (5) in subsequent years.

drawn salary” means the corresponding last drawn salary
which had been adjusted on 1 January 2014 pursuant to this
Act before the coming into operation of this section.”.
