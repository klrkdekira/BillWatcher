The proposed section 6c seeks to provide the circumstances in which an

Act 1967 in relation to appeal and its procedures shall be applicable to an
appeal or further appeal made under Act 445.

9. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 9 of Act 445 to clarify that the profit
of a Labuan entity carrying on a Labuan business activity which is a Labuan

derived from intellectual property right is subject to tax under the Income
Tax Act 1967.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new section_ 13a into Act 445 to provide

that the tax payable in consequence to an assessment made under section 6

be recoverable as tax due and payable under Act 445.
