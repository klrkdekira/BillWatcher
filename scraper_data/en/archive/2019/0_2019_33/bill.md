francais”, “pemegang subfrancais” and “perunding francais” the words
“francaisor”, “francaisi”, “subfrancaisi” and “konsultan francais” respectively,
to be in line with the latest developments of the usage of such words in the
franchise business.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to introduce the definition for the words “subfranchise”_
and “subfranchisee” into section 4 of Act 590. This _clause also seeks to_
amend section 4 in the national language text in relation to the definitions
consequential to the proposed amendments in _clause 2._

registration of the franchise under Act 590.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce new sections 10a and 10b into Act 590._

franchisee to display his franchise registration in a conspicuous position at the
place where the franchisor or franchisee carries on his business in order to
notify the public of the franchise and to prevent any person from deceiving or
cheating the public. Failure to comply with subsection 10b(1) is an offence under
Act 590.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 11 of Act 590 to require an applicant,_

or his director or manager, to obtain the approval of the Registrar to amend the
documents mentioned in paragraphs 7(1)(b), _(c) and_ _(d) of Act 590 to ensure_
such documents are not amended arbitrarily without the Registrar’s approval.

section 14b requires a franchise broker or franchise consultant to display his
registration as a franchise broker or franchise consultant, as the case may
be, in a conspicuous position at a place where he carries on his business or
provides his services. Failure to comply with subsection 14b(1) is an offence
under Act 590.
