EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012 (“Act 736”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.


-----

4 _Bill_

3. _Clauses 2, 3 and_ _7 seek to amend sections 3, 4 and 21 of Act 736_
respectively to do away with the offence relating to a street protest. Due to
the change of policy of the Government, the Government is of the view that
the right to assemble peaceably and without arms may include the right to
organize or participate in a street protest so long as the street protest does
not pose any threat to or affect the security of the Federation or public order.
The street protest must also be held in a manner that takes into account the
protection of the rights and freedom of other persons. In the event that a street
protest causes any nuisance, or involves any act of violence or commission
of any criminal offence, such act may be dealt with under other existing laws
such as the Penal Code [Act 574] and Criminal Procedure Code [Act 593].

4. _Clause 4_ seeks to amend section 9 of Act 736 to shorten the notification
period of an assembly from ten days to seven days, before the date of the
assembly. This is to further facilitate the holding of peaceful assemblies.

5. _Clauses 5 and 6 seek to amend sections 12 and 16 of Act 736 respectively_
consequential to the amendment made to section 9 of Act 736.

6. _Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section 21a to provide for the power_
to compound offences punishable under sections 9 and 15 of Act 736.

7. _Clause 9 contains savings provision._

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN(U2)3147]
