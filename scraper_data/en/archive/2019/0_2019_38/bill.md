EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1950 (“Act 527”).
Act 527 regulates the carriage of goods by sea in Peninsular Malaysia by adopting
the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to
Bills of Lading (“Hague Rules”) that is incorporated as the First Schedule in Act 527.
The main purpose of the amendment of Act 527 is to insert the provision for
the implementation of the Protocol to Amend the International Convention for
the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading (“Visby
Rules”) and Protocol (SDR Protocol) Amending the International Convention
for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading of
25 August 1924 (The Hague Rules), as amended by the Protocol of 23 February 1968
(Visby Rules). The two Protocols are known as the “Visby Rules” and the
“SDR Protocol” respectively. Act 527 contains procedures that are no longer
in line with the global practice in maritime trade industry. The provisions of
the Hague Rules as provided in the First Schedule to Act 527 are inadequate
to meet the current conditions and practices of carriage of goods by sea. While
Malaysia under Act 527 adopts the Hague Rules, many other countries have
adopted the Visby Rules and the SDR Protocol in its maritime trade legislations.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the provision on the commencement_
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clauses 2_ and _3 seek to amend sections 4 and 6 of Act 527 respectively_
to extend the scope of documents relating to shipping transactions, which
currently is limited to bills of lading. In keeping abreast with the development
of international maritime industry practices, references will now be made to
sea carriage document, which includes bill of lading.

_Carriage of Goods by Sea (Amendment)_ 3

4. _Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new section 6a into Act 527. The proposed_
new section 6a seeks to empower the Minister to amend the Schedule by way
of order published in the Gazette. Currently, any amendments to the Schedule
is to be made by way of an amendment law tabled in Parliament. The new
section 6a will ensure that Act 527 is up to date with the global development
in maritime trade practice and provide a conducive environment for Malaysia
as a maritime trading hub. The Order made under the new section 6a and the
proposed Act will come into operation simultaneously.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN(U2)3193]
