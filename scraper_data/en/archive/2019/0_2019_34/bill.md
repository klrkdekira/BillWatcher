2. Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement date

the Minister to make regulations in respect of the manner in which any dispute
relating to royalties may be heard by the Tribunal and the procedure to be
adopted by the Tribunal when hearing such dispute, respectively.

5. Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new section 59c into Act 332 to provide
that the Tribunal may hear and determine any dispute relating to royalties
arising between a licensing body and any of its members such as an author,
