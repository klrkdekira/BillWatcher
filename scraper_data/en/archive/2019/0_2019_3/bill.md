the coming into operation of the amendments to sections 14 and 15 of
Act 438 is already a resident within a free commercial zone, to be allowed
to continue to take, hold or enjoy any movable or immovable property and
saving provisions relating to any building which on the coming into operation
of the proposed Act is still under construction. _Subclause 18(3) seeks to save_
