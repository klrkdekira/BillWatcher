2 _Bill_

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Federal Constitution.

2. _Clause 2_ of this Bill seeks to substitute Clause (2) of Article 1 of the
Federal Constitution to specify all the constituent States of the Federation by
restoring, with modifications, the position of Clause (2) of Article 1 of the
Federal Constitution during the formation of Malaysia in 1963. This amendment
is made in line with the spirit of the Malaysia Agreement concluded in 1963.
It satisfies the aspiration and hope of the State Governments of Sabah and
Sarawak, and all people of Sabah and Sarawak. This amendment does not,
in any way, alter the functions of the Federal and State Governments under
the concept of federalism.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN(U2)3160]
