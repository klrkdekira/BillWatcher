EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Revision of Laws Act 1968 (“Act 1”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and commencement date of the proposed_
Act.

3. _Clause_ _2 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 1 to introduce a new paragraph (xviia)_
into subsection (1) to empower the Commissioner of Law Revision to make
any alteration in any written law to reflect any change of the style and title or
the transfer of any functions or responsibility of a Minister or the change of
the name of any Ministry from time to time in accordance with the Ministerial
Functions Order made under the Ministerial Functions Act 1969 [Act 2].

Currently, as provided in section 4 of the Ministerial Functions Act 1969

and subsection 8(2) of the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967 [Act 388], any
reference to the style and title of a Minister in any written law refers to the
Minister for the time being conferred with the functions or charged with the
responsibility for the matters under such written law, or to the Minister for
the time being assigned with such style and title.

With this proposed amendment, the Commissioner of Law Revision will

be able to make necessary alterations in any written law from time to time
to be in line with the Ministerial Functions Order.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend subsection 14(2) as a consequence of the
amendment of section 6. With this proposed amendment, the Commissioner
of Law Revision will have the power to make such alterations as provided
in the proposed _clause 2 by way of reprint of laws._

the date of the change of the style and title, or the transfer of any functions
or responsibility of any Minister, or the change of the name of any Ministry.
