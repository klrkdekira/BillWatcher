EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1967 (“Act 177”) to
provide among others, for the post of Deputy President of the Industrial Court,
to empower the Director General instead of the Minister to refer a complaint
to the Industrial Court for hearing, to allow an appeal of any decision of
the Industrial Court to be made to the High Court and to provide for the
application of Part VI of Act 177 to any statutory authority as determined by
the Minister after consultation with the statutory authority.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act and the power of the_
Minister to appoint different dates for the coming into operation of different
provisions of the proposed Act.


-----

18 _Bill_

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to define the President of the Industrial Court to include
the Deputy President of the Industrial Court.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to replace the power of the Minister with the power of
the Director General under section 8 of Act 177 to refer a complaint to the
Industrial Court for hearing in order to expedite the process of reference of
complaints to the Industrial Court.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 9 of Act 177 to expedite dispute resolution_
processes relating to a dispute as to the capacity of a workman and a dispute
in respect of a claim for recognition by a trade union of workmen to represent
any workmen or class of workmen, by replacing the power of the Minister
with the power of the Director General to resolve the disputes. _Clause 5 also_
removes the discretion of the Director General to refer to the Director General
of Trade Unions for him to ascertain the competence of the trade union of
workmen concerned to represent any workmen or any class of workmen.

6. _Clause 6_ seeks to prohibit any workman from going on strike after the
Director General has made a decision under section 9 of Act 177 even though
the workmen may be dissatisfied with his decision. Previously the decision
was made by the Minister.

claim for recognition under section 9 of Act 177 until a claim is resolved under

or a decision is made by the Director General in respect of a claim for
recognition by a trade union in respect of any workmen or a class of workmen
under the same section. Previously the decision was made by the Minister.

8. _Clause 8_ seeks to reduce the time period from three years to one year in
which a trade union of workmen is barred from making any claim for recognition
in respect of the same workmen or class of workmen in which another trade
union of workmen has been accorded recognition. Such recognition which
can be accorded by the Minister previously is now accorded by the Director
General.

9. _Clause 10_ seeks to introduce a new section 12A to address issues where
there are more than one trade unions of workmen by providing procedures
for a trade union of workmen to be selected as the trade union with the
sole bargaining rights to represent the same workmen or class of workmen.
_Clause 10 also seeks to introduce a new section 12b_ to provide that where a
trade union of workmen has obtained the sole bargaining rights to represent
any workmen or class of workmen, no other trade unions shall have the same
rights for a period of three years or unless the trade union of workmen which
has obtained the sole bargaining rights has ceased to exist.

_Industrial Relations (Amendment)_ 19

10. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend section 13 of Act 177 to add two procedures

that is by the trade unions of workmen or the Director General, pursuant to
section 12a. _Clause 11 also seeks to bar the employers, trade union of_
employers and trade union of workmen from extending an invitation to
commence collective bargaining until three months before the expiry of
the existing collective agreement. This amendment also seeks to enable the
trade union of workmen to raise matters of a general character stated in
paragraphs 13(3) _(a) to_ _(f)_ of Act 177 in the course of any discussion with
an employer or trade union of employers.

11. _Clause 12_ seeks to amend section 20 of the Act 177 to replace the

power of the Minister with the power of the Director General to refer
representations of dismissal by a workman to the Industrial Court for an
award in order to expedite the process. Clause 12 also seeks to introduce new
subparagraphs (6)(a)(iv) and 6(b)(iv) to allow an employer and a workman,
additional options during proceedings with the Director General, to be represented
by any person, except an advocate and solicitor. _Clause 12 further seeks to_
introduce a new section 20(6A) to enable the next-of-kin of any workman
with mental disability to apply to the High Court for an order to appoint a
guardian ad-litem for such workman.

12. _Clause 13 seeks to introduce a new paragraph 21(1)(aa) into Act 177_

for the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to appoint a Deputy President of the Industrial
Court.

13. _Clauses 14 and_ _15_ seek to amend subsections 22(5) and 23(4) of

Act 177 to allow the President of the Industrial Court and the Chairman of
the Industrial Court to sit alone when dealing with any complaint of noncompliance of an award for a reference made under subsection 20(3) of Act
177 in order to expedite the process.

14. _Clause 16_ seeks to enable officers from the ministry charged with the

responsibility for human resources with at least fifteen years of experience
in labour and industrial relations and who is a qualified person as defined in
the Legal Profession Act 1976 [Act 166] to be considered for the appointment
as a Chairman under subsection 23(2) of Act 177.

15. _Clause 17 seeks to introduce a new subsection 25(3) into Act 177 to_

restrict the appointment of the Registrar, Deputy Registrars and Assistant
Registrars to any person from the Industrial Relations Officers Scheme of
Service.

Act 177 to provide that any reference to the Industrial Court without the
consent of the parties in respect of a refusal to commence collective bargaining
or a deadlock in collective bargaining can only be made subject to certain
conditions as listed out in the said subsection.


-----

20 _Bill_

17. _Clause 19_ seeks to amend section 29 of the Act 177 to empower the

Industrial Court to hear and determine the matter before it notwithstanding
the date of dismissal as stated in the Director General’s reference is disputed
by the parties or is incorrect. _Clause 19_ also seeks to allow the Industrial
Court to continue with the hearing of a case notwithstanding the death of the
workman who made the representations.

18. _Clause 20 seeks to amend section 30 of Act 177 to enable the Industrial_

Court to impose interest for awards relating to payment of money as a deterrent
measure against the delay in compliance with the awards. Clause 20 also seeks
