EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Workers’ Minimum Standards of Housing and
Amenities Act 1990 (“Act 446”) to be in line with the evolution of international
labour standards especially in terms of compliance with the standards as
practiced by developing countries, which are in line with the International
Labour Organization, specifically Recommendation 115 – Worker’s Housing
Recommendation, 1961.

This Bill seeks to expand the coverage of Act 446, which previously applied
only to estate employees, to other employment sectors. The Bill aims to help
sustain the economic growth of the country and attract foreign investments
especially in high-tech industries.

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and the provision on the commencement
of the proposed Act.


-----

18 _Bill_

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend the long title of Act 446 to extend its scope to
cover other employment sectors in addition to the estate sector, in that Act 446
would now have the power to regulate minimum standards of accommodation
for employees whose place of employment is other than the estates.

4. Clause 3 seeks to provide for a general amendment to the English language text
to substitute for the word “worker” the word “employee”, the word “workers” the
word “employees”, the words “a worker” the words “an employee” and the word
“workers’ ” the word “employees’ ”, to be consistent with the Employment Act 1955

[Act 265]. The _clause_ also seeks to amend sections 18, 20 and 33 to increase
the punishments imposed for offences under those sections.

5. Clause 4 seeks to amend the short title of Act 446 to reflect the extension
of its scope to cover other employment sectors in addition to the estate sector.
The proposed provision also amends the scope of application of Act 446, which
previously applies throughout Malaysia, to only apply to Peninsular Malaysia
and the Federal Territory of Labuan. This follows consultations made with
the Government of Sabah and the Government of Sarawak. In this regard,
the Government of Sabah and the Government of Sarawak have agreed that
corresponding laws will be provided in their Labour Ordinance (Sabah Cap. 67)
and Labour Ordinance (Sarawak Cap. 76).

6. Clause 5 seeks to provide that any reference to the Workers’ Minimum
Standards of Housing and Amenities Act 1990 in any written law or document
shall, when the proposed Act comes into operation, be construed as references
to the Employees’ Minimum Standards of Housing, Accommodations and
Amenities Act 1990.

7. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 446 to limit the extent of the
application of Part II of Act 446 in respect of the provision of housing and
amenities to employees whose places of employment or part thereof which
are situated in places other than within the area of a City Council, Municipal
Council or a Federal Territory.

8. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 446 to introduce a new definition
and amend certain existing definitions.

9. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 10 of Act 446 by substituting for the
terms “workers” and “workers’ ” the terms “employees” and “employees’ ”
respectively. The proposed provision further seeks to provide that an employer,
if ordered to do so by the Director General, is under the obligation to provide
a nursery if the employees have together at least five dependants under four
years of age living with them. Previously, an employer was under such duty
if there were at least ten dependants under four years of age living with the
employees. The proposed provision also seeks to increase the punishments
imposed for an offence under this section.

10. Clauses 9 and 10 are amendments to sections 11 and 12 respectively in
consequence of amending the term “worker” to “employee”. The proposed
provisions also seek to increase the punishments imposed for offences under
those sections.

11. _Clause 11 ­seeks to amend section 13 of Act 446 to prevent an employer_

from imposing any payment as rent or charge on his estate employees who
are provided with housing and amenities

centralized accommodation provider to ensure that all accommodations provided
to employees are in compliance with the minimum standards specified under

building and construction requirements under other relevant written laws, in
addition to the compliance required under Act 446. In practice, an employer
