EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Federal Constitution.

2. _Clause 1 of this Bill_ provides for the short title of the proposed Act and
the power of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to appoint the date of coming into
operation of _clause 3 of the proposed Act._ _Clauses 2 and_ _4 shall come into_
operation on the date immediately following the date of the publication of the
proposed Act in the Gazette in accordance with section 19 of the Interpretation
Acts 1948 and 1967 [Act 388].

3. _Clause 2_ of this Bill seeks to amend paragraph _(b)_ of Article 47 of the
Federal Constitution to lower the age of a citizen who is qualified to be a
member of the House of Representatives from twenty-one years to eighteen
years.

4. _Clause 3 of this Bill seeks to amend Article 119 of the Federal Constitution._
_Subclause 3(a)_ seeks to amend paragraph _(a)_ of Clause (1) of Article 119 of
the Federal Constitution to lower the age of a citizen who is entitled to vote
from twenty-one years to eighteen years. This would allow more Malaysian
citizens to vote.

Currently, a person is required to apply for registration as an elector in a

constituency and qualifying date in paragraph (b) of Clause (4) of Article 119
of the Federal Constitution refers to the date of such application. Subclause 3(b)
seeks to amend the definition of “qualifying date” in paragraph (b) of Clause (4)
of Article 119 to mean the date on which a person is registered by the Election
Commission as an elector in a constituency. With this amendment, when a
citizen attains the age of eighteen years and is qualified to vote, he will be
automatically registered as an elector by the Election Commission.

5. _Clause 4_ of this Bill seeks to amend section 5 of the Eighth Schedule
to the Federal Constitution to lower the age of a citizen who is qualified to
be a member of the Legislative Assembly from twenty-one years to eighteen
years similar to the proposed amendment to Article 47 in _clause 2._

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN(U2)3160]
