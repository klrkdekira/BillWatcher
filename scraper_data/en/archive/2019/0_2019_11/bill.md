EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Youth Societies and Youth Development Act
2007 (“Act 668”) to lower the maximum age limit in the definition of “youth”
to thirty years old, to provide for the minimum and maximum age limits of
the head and office-bearers of a youth society and to remove the requirement
of publication in the _Gazette_ for any cancellation of registration of a youth
society.

2. _Clause 1 provides for the short title of the proposed Act and the power_
of the Minister to appoint different dates for the coming into operation of
different provisions of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 2 of Act 668 to alter certain existing
definitions as follows:

_(a)_ to amend the definitions of “youth” and “youth society” to lower

the maximum age limit of youth and members of a youth society
from forty years old to thirty years old as sets out in the Malaysian
Youth Policy (“MYP”). The MYP was formulated based on
four concepts that is to overcome the challenges faced by youth
by strengthening and highlighting the youth potential. One of
the concepts of MYP is to ensure that the age limit of youth is
in line with international standards. The rationale for lowering
the maximum age limit of youth is to ensure the sustainability of
future leadership of the nation, reduce the generation gap among
youth, accelerate the process of youth maturity and reduce the risk
behaviours in the youth group; and

_(b)_ to amend the definition of “office-bearers” to provide for the minimum

and maximum age limits of an office-bearer of a registered youth
society. With the proposed amendment, the minimum and maximum
age limits of any member appointed or elected as an office-bearer
shall not be less than eighteen years old and not more than thirty
years old on the date of his appointment.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 12 of Act 668 to provide for the minimum_
and maximum age limits of a head of youth society. With the proposed
amendment, the minimum and maximum age limits of a head of youth society
shall not be less than eighteen years old and not more than thirty years old on
the date of his appointment. The proposed amendment also seeks to shorten
the period to hold office as head of youth society from six years to four years
continuously. The purpose of this amendment is to create more opportunities
for members of youth societies to hold office as head and to enhance
the leadership skills of more youths.

age limit of the cessation of disqualification of an office-bearer of a registered
youth society. This is a consequential amendment to the amendment of
the definition of “office-bearers”.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend subsection 20(6) of Act 668 to remove_
the requirement of having to publish in the _Gazette a cancellation of_
the registration of a youth society.
