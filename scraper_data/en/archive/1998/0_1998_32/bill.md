EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1967, the Real Property Gains
Tax Act 1976 and the Labuan Offshore Business Activity Tax Act 1990.

CHAPTER II

AMENDMENTS TO THE INCOME TAX ACT 1967

The Income Tax Act 1967 is referred to in this Chapter as "Act 53".


-----

### Bill

_2._ _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 13 of Act 53. With this amendment, a_
benefit consisting of a leave passage for travel between Malaysia and any
place outside Malaysia is restricted to three thousand ringgit. Any amount in
excess of three thousand ringgit will now be assessable to tax. This amendment
will be effective from 24 October 1998.

3. _Clause 5 seeks to amend paragraph 34(6)(h) of Act 53 so that the approving_
authority for a deduction under that paragraph is no longer the relevant authority
but the Minister of Finance. The amendment will be effective from the year
of assessment 1999.

4. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 44 of Act 53. Paragraph 44(1)(b) is_
amended to allow a deduction made under the new Schedule 4c. Subsections
44(6) and 44(6A) are amended to include a reference to Schedule 4c as a
consequence of the amendment to paragraph 44(1)(b). These amendments will
be effective from the year of assessment 2000.

5. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 54A of Act 53. The proposed amendment
is to include the income in respect of a voyage or time charter of a Malaysian
ship owned by a resident person as income exempt from tax. Income from the
business of transporting passengers or cargo is still exempt from tax. In view
of the amendment to subsection 54A(1), the definition of "transporting passengers
or cargo" in subsection 54A(6) is no longer appropriate and is therefore deleted.
These amendments will be effective from the year of assessment 1999.

6. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 60 of Act 53. The amendment is to_
provide that the income of the shareholders' fund shall include the amount of
actuarial surplus that is transferred from the life fund to the shareholders'
fund. Prior to this amendment, the income of the shareholders' fund includes
the amount of the adjusted actuarial surplus arising from the life fund as is
apportioned to the shareholders' fund. This amendment will be effective from
the year of assessment 1999.

7. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 130 of Act 53. With the amendment the_
relief is now only available to a non-resident individual if he is a citizen and
is in the employment of the public services or the service of a statutory authority
and he becomes a non-resident by reason of that employment. This amendment
will be effective from the year of assessment 1999.

8. _Clause JO seeks to introduce a new Schedule 4c into Act 53. In the proposed_
Schedule, provisions are made to enable a company to surrender its adjusted
loss in respect of an approved food production project to a related company.
The meaning of a related company is provided in paragraph 3 of the proposed
Schedule. The adjusted loss which is surrendered will be available as a deduction
against the aggregate income of the related company pursuant to section 44.
Any adjusted loss that is not surrendered in a year of assessment will, in
accordance with the law, be/ carried forward and cannot be surrendered in the
subsequent years of assessment. This amendment will be effective from the
year of assessment 2000.


-----

### Finance (No. 2)

9. Clause 11 seeks to amend Schedule 6 to Act 53. Paragraph 30 is amended
so that the pension received by an individual, whether or not he is resident,
is exempt from tax. Paragraph 35A is introduced to provide that interest income
received by a unit trust is also exempt from tax. These amendments will be
effective from the year of assessment 1999.

10. _Clause 13 seeks to amend Schedule 7A to Act 53. Subparagraph l(c) is_

deleted so that the criterion relating to an increase in productivity is no longer
a prerequisite for a company to qualify for a reinvestment allowance. This
amendment shall be deemed to be effective from the year of assessment 1998.

CHAPTER III

AMENDMENT TO THE REAL PROPERTY GAINS TAX ACT 1976

11. _Clause 15 seeks to amend paragraph 53(2)(a) of the Real Property Gains_

Tax Act 1976. The amendment provides for the manner in which the service
of notices in the case of a company, partnership or body of persons, having
a registered office in Malaysia, is to be effected. This amendment will be
effective from the date of coming into operation of this Act.

CHAPTER IV

AMENDMENTS TO THE LABUAN OFFSHORE BUSINESS

ACTIVITY TAX ACT 1990

The Labuan Offshore Business Activity Tax Act 1990 is referred to in this
Chapter as "Act 445".

12. _Clause 17 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 445. The amendment is to_

introduce a new proviso to the definition of "offshore business activity".
Consequently, an offshore company carrying on either the business of money-
broking or leasing may now carry on such business with residents. Paragraph
_(f) is introduced into the proviso to enable the Minister to approve a specific_
offshore trading or offshore non-trading activity to be carried on with residents
or transactions to be carried on in Malaysian currency. The amendment also
provides for a definition of "shipping operations" so that shipping operations
relating to the charter of ships on a "bareboat" basis shall constitute an offshore
business activity. These amendments will be effective from the year of assessment

1999.

13. _Clause 18 seeks to delete section 10A of Act 445. With this amendment,_

an offshore company shall no longer have the option of paying to the Labuan
Offshore Financial Services Authority a fee specified under section 151 of the
Offshore Companies Act 1990 in lieu of tax. This amendment will be effective
from the year of assessment 1999.


-----

_Bill_
