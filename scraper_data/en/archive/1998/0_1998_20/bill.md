EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Companies Act 1965 ("Act 125"), primarily to
ensure greater transparency in shareholding in companies.

2. _Clause 1 of the Bill contains the short title and the power of the Minister_

to appoint the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. Section 67A of Act 125 was inserted to enable companies to buy back their

shares. However, the existing provisions require the shares to be subsequently
cancelled. The amendment proposed in clause 2 of the Bill seeks to provide
for an alternative to such cancellation. Under the proposed amendment, the
company may opt to retain the shares in treasury. The amendment proposed
to section 67A also seeks to remove the provision permitting a company to
provide financial assistance to any person for the purpose of purchasing its
shares.


-----

_Companies (Amendment) (No. 2)_

4. _Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend section 68 of Act 125 to increase from_

five years to ten years the period during which a person may take up unissued

shares of a public company upon being granted the option to do so by the
company.

5. _Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 68A into Act 125. The_

new section requires a company to keep a register of options granted to persons
to take up unissued shares in the company. Particulars of such persons must
be entered in the register within 14 days after the grant of the option.

6. _Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to amend section 69A of Act 125 to increase the_

maximum fine for non-compliance with the disclosure requirements in that
section. The proposed fine is one million ringgit instead of the existing fine of
fifty thousand ringgit.

7. _Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to amend section 69D of Act 125 to redefine what_

is meant by a substantial shareholder. Under the existing provision, a shareholder
is a substantial shareholder if he holds not less than 5 percent of the shares of
a company. The amendment proposed seeks to reduce that limit to 2 percent.

8. _Clauses 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill seeks to amend sections 69E, 69F and 69G_

of Act 125 to reduce from 14 days to 7 days the period during which a person
who becomes a substantial shareholder or ceases to be a substantial shareholder
of a company, or whose interests in the company have changed, must notify
the company.

9. _Clause 10 of the Bill seeks to amend section 69M of Act 125 to increase_

the maximum fine for non-compliance with disclosure requirements in sections
69E, 69F, 69G and 69J from five thousand ringgit to one million ringgit. It also
seeks to increase the penalty for a continuing offence from five hundred ringgit
to fifty thousand ringgit for each day.

10. _Clause 11 of the Bill seeks to amend section 69o of Act 125 to increase_

the maximum fine which can be imposed on a member of a company for failing
to comply with a notice by the company requiring him to disclose his beneficial
interest in the voting shares of the company. The proposed amendment seeks
to increase the maximum fine from five thousand ringgit to one million ringgit.

_Clause 11 also seeks to empower the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and the_

Securities Commission to direct a company to use its power under section 69D
to require a member of the company to disclose his interest in the shares of
that company.

11. Clause 12 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 69P into Act 125.

The new provision seeks to deem nominee companies and others acting as bare
trustees to be substantial shareholders if they hold more than two per cent of
all the voting shares of a company. Consequently, the disclosure requirements
under sections 69E, 69F and 69G would apply to them.


-----

## Bill

12. _Clause 13 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new Division 6A into Part IV_

of Act 125. The proposed new Division contains 6 sections, namely, sections

107A, 107B, 107c, 107D, 107E and 107F.

Section 107A contains the definitions of terms used in the new Division.

Section 107B seeks to recognize a person who has deposited his securities

in a company with a central depository ("depositor") as a member of the
company. It also seeks to recognize the record of depositors kept by a central
depository as a register of members. Thus, the register of members maintained
by a company would only contain the name and details of the central depository
or its nominee company as the sole member of the company so long as the
securities of the company are deposited with the central depository.

Section 107c seeks to make it compulsory for transfers of securities of a

company deposited with a central depository to be transacted by way of book
entries only, to be effected by the central depository. The company would no
longer be able to register and effect such transfer.

Section 107D seeks to ensure that the record of depositors is not subject to

rectification by the Court. However, the Court would have the power to grant
remedies to aggrieved parties.

Section 107E contains provisions intended to protect a central depository and

its record of depositors from any proceeding in relation to the disposal of the
property of a company after the commencement of the winding up of the
company. Section 223 of Act 125, which declares that any disposal of property
made within 6 months from the date of commencement of the winding up of
a company is void, is made inapplicable to the disposition of property made
by way of book entry by the central depository. However, the Court is empowered
to award damages or to make other orders except an order for the rectification
of the record of depositors

Section 107F seeks to empower the Minister to grant exemptions from the

provisions of the new Division.

13. _Clause 14 seeks to amend section 176 of Act 125 to ensure that creditors_

are aware of an application made under subsection (10) and to ascertain that
restraining orders under that subsection are only granted under specific conditions
to avoid any abuse.

14. _Clause 15 seeks to amend section 365 of Act 125 to only allow dividends_

to be paid in respect of a financial year only up to an amount not exceeding
the after-tax profit of that financial year or the average of the dividends declared
for the two years preceding that financial year. This provision will not apply
to subsidiaries of holding companies, private companies which are wholly-
owned by Malaysians and a company whose financial year commenced before

1 July 1997.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN. (U[2]) 2100.]
