EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 ("the Act").

2. _Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 2 of the Act by_

inserting a new definition of "licensed pharmacist" to mean a registered
pharmacist who holds a Type A Poison Licence issued under the
Poisons Act 1952. This definition is introduced for the purpose of
the proposed amendment to subsection 16(2) of the Act.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 12 to increase the maximum
fine for offences relating to the possession of dangerous drugs from
twenty thousand ringgit to one hundred thousand ringgit. It also
seeks to introduce a new subsection (4) which provides that public
officers employed at any prison, rehabilitation centre, police lock-
up or any place of detention who contravene the provisions of
subsection 12(2) are also liable to whipping.

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 16 of the Act by substituting
for the words "person who is licensed to sell by retail poisons" the
words "licensed pharmacist" which include manufacturing pharmacists
who are usually not involved in any retail sale of poisons.

### Bill

_5._ _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 37 to insert 14 types of_
Amphetamine Type Stimulants as dangerous drugs so that a person
found in possession of any of such drugs in the specified amount
will be presumed to be trafficking in the drug.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 38A to empower the Court to
deal with a juvenile offender in accordance with the provisions of
the Drug Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983.

7. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 38B to require an offender_
found guilty under section 15 of the Act to undergo supervision by
a Rehabilitation Officer or a police officer after having undergone
the punishment imposed on him.

8. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 39A to insert 14 types of
Amphetamine Type Stimulants as dangerous drugs so that a person
found to be in possession of any of such drugs in amounts which
are less than those which can give rise to the presumption that he
is trafficking in such drug will be subject to the increased penalty
provided in that section.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
