_Environmental Quality (Amendment)_ 3

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Environmental Quality Act 1974 ("the
Act").

2. _Clauses 1 and 2 seek to provide respectively for the short title_
and commencement date of the amendment Act.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to introduce three new sections into the Act,_
namely sections 29A, 290 and 29c.

The proposed section 29A spells out the prohibition on open
burning. The heavy penalty provided for the offence of open burning
is in the public interest and is meant to be deterrent and sufficiently
punitive since open burning is considered hazardous to air quality
and health.

The proposed section 29B provides that if open burning occurs
on any premises the owner or the occupier of the premises who has
control over such premises is deemed to have committed the offence
of open burning unless the contrary is proved.

The proposed section 29c makes available to the person, owner
or occupier of the premises where open burning occurred the defence
of lack of control, or no knowledge or connivance or consent in
the matter. It is also a defence if he proves that he had taken all
reasonable precautions or exercised all due diligence to prevent the
commission of the offence.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to substitute the existing section 44 with a new_
provision in order to spell out the requirement that no prosecution
shall be instituted under the Act or the regulations made thereunder
without the consent in writing of the Public Prosecutor. This proposed
amendment is made necessary by the decision of the court in the
case of Repco Holdings Berhad Iwn. Pendakwa Raya delivered on
2 October 1997. It will harmonise the Act and make it consistent
with Clause (3) of Article 145 of the Federal Constitution.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN.(U[2])2084.]
