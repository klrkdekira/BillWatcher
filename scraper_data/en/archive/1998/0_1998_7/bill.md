EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Courts of Judicature Act 1964
("Act 91").

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 91._

At the moment, in the course of hearing a case, if the court

decides on the admissibility of any evidence or document, the
dissatisfied party may file an appeal. If such appeal is filed, the
court has to stop the trial pending the decision of the appeal by
the superior court. This causes a long delay in the completion of
the hearing, especially when an appeal is filed against every ruling
made by the trial court. The amendment is proposed in order to
help expedite the hearing of cases in trial courts.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to amend subsection 10(1) of Act 91._

The appointments of officers as Chief Registrar, Registrars, Deputy

Registrars and Senior Assistant Registrars are made by the Yang
di-Pertuan Agong. At the moment these appointments are made on
the recommendation of the Chief Justice although there is no express
provision in the law for such recommendation. The amendment is
proposed in order to ensure that there is express provision in subsection

10(1) for such recommendation.

## 4 Bill

4. _Clauses 4 and 6 seek to amend sections 42 and 78 of Act 91._

The Court of Appeal and the Federal Court each sits with three

Judges. Where a reserved judgment has been written but, through
illness or otherwise, one Judge is unable to sit, the judgment cannot
be delivered without the consent of both parties to the appeal. The
appeal will have to be reheard and this will mean that more expenses
will have to be incurred and the outcome of the case will be delayed.
It is therefore proposed that the words "if the parties consent" in
section 42 (in respect of the Court of Appeal) and section 78 (in
respect of the Federal Court) be taken out so that the hearing can
be concluded without delay.

5. _Clauses 5 and 7 seek to amend sections 44 and 80 of Act 91._

The amendments are proposed in order to ensure that an application

to a panel of three Judges of the Court of Appeal (in the case of
the amendment to section 44) or the Federal Court (in the case of
the amendment to section 80) for a review of an order made by
a single Judge of the Court is made by an aggrieved party within
ten days of the order being served. This will ensure that there is
no delay in the making of such an application as such delay will
result in delay in the disposal of the matter in court.

6. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 96 of Act 91._

Appeals from the High Court in the exercise of its original

jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal are automatic. However, appeals

to the Federal Court from the Court of Appeal may only be made
with the leave of the Federal Court. Since 1886, the principles
applied by the English Courts in granting leave have been those
principles which the proposed amendments seek to incorporate in
section 96. These are sound principles which have been followed
by Malaysian Courts. Putting these principles in the statute will
eliminate lengthy arguments and hasten the disposal of applications
for leave to appeal.

In view of the amendment, it is necessary to express in clear

words that all orders made by the Court in respect of applications
for leave to appeal shall not be nullified.

7. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 97 of Act 91 by inserting a_

new subsection (3).

An application for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal to

the Federal Court is currently heard by a panel of three Judges of
the Federal Court. This is a waste of the court's time. An application
for leave to appeal is considered to be interlocutory matter. If an


-----

_Courts of Judicature (Amendment)_ 5

application for leave to appeal can be heard by a single Judge, three
such applications can be heard by three Judges sitting separately
but simultaneously and thus expedite the disposal of those applications.
Those unhappy with an order made by a Judge can apply to be
heard by the full panel of three Judges.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN.(U[2])2083.]
