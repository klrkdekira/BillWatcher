value, or that its value is so small as, in the opinion of
the Magistrate, to render impracticable the sale, as provided

in the custody of the Investigating Officer of the
Commission unreasonable in view of the expense or
inconvenience that would thereby be involved, the


-----

_Bill_

Magistrate may order such property to be destroyed or
otherwise disposed of, either on the expiration of such

make a claim within six months from the date of such
public notification.

the property has a value of fifty ringgit or more, be
published in the Gazette.

notification under subsection (1) no person establishes a

such property was found is unable to show that it was
legally acquired by him, such property may, after the
expiration of such period of three months, be sold on the
order of the Chairman acting on behalf of the Commission.

(4) If within six months from the publication of a

notification under subsection (1) no person has established

or, if sold, of the net proceeds of such sale, shall upon
the expiration of such period of six months pass to and
become vested in the Federal Government.

(5) Where the property referred to in subsection (1) is

subject to speedy and natural decay or the Chairman
acting on behalf of the Commission is of the opinion that
its value is less than fifty ringgit or where its custody
involves unreasonable expense and inconvenience, such

(2), (3) and (4) shall, as nearly as may be practicable,
apply to the net proceeds of such sale as they apply to

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Securities Commission Act 1993 ("Act 498").

2. _Clause 1 of the Bill contains the short title and the power of the Minister_

to appoint the date of commencement of the proposed Act.


-----

_Securities Commission (Amendment)_

3. _Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 2 of Act 498 to expand the_

definition of "Court" so as to include subordinate courts, Sessions Court Judges
and Magistrates.

4. _Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend subsections 35(1) and (2) of Act 498_

by removing the word "inspection" since the proposed new sections 35A and

35B would deal with powers of inspection.

5. Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to introduce new sections 35A and 35B into Act
498 so as to enable the Commission or an Investigating Officer of the Commission
to examine, without any prior notice, the books or other documents, accounts
and transactions of a licensed person. The new sections make it an offence for
a licensed person to fail to allow access to, to give possession of, or to produce
these books or other documents to the Commission or Investigating Officer of
the Commission.

6. _Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to introduce new sections 36A, 36B and 36c into_

Act 498 to provide for the procedure to be followed where any property is
seized by an Investigating Officer of the Commission in the course of an

investigation or inspection. The provisions in the new sections are substantially
similar to the procedure contained in the Criminal Procedure Code in relation
to property seized by the police under that Code.

_Clause 6 also seeks to introduce a new section 36D into Act 498 so as to_

enable an Investigating Ot'ficer of the Commission with the approval of the
Commission to require any person who is the subject of an investigation to
surrender his certificate of identity, passport or other travel documents in his
possession.

7, _Clause 7 of the Bill seeks to amend section 38 of Act 498 to enable an_

Investigating Officer to require any person whom he believes can give information
relevant to an investigation to provide all reasonable assistance and to appear
before him to be examined orally.

8. Clause 8 of the Bill seeks to introduce a new section 38A into Part V of
Act 498 to make the act of destroying, concealing, mutilating or altering records
and accounts and of removing such records or accounts from any premises in
order to delay or obstruct any examination or audit or investigation an offence.

9. Clause 10 of the Bill seeks to introduce new sections 39c. 39D, 39E, 39F
and 39G into Act 498. The new section 39c provides for the compounding of
offences. The new section 39D provides for the protection of informers and
information. The new section 39B defines offences which are seizable offences.
The new section 39F imposes a duty on an Investigating Officer of the Commission
to make over arrested persons to the police, while the new section 39G provides
that a Magistrate authorising the detention of a person arrested under the proposed
section 39E must authorise the detention of the arrested person in the custody
of the police.


-----

## Bill

10. Clause 12 of the Bill seeks to amend section 43B of Act 498 to insert the
element of public interest into the Commission's consideration whether to give
assistance to a foreign authority exercising functions similar to those conferred
on the Commission as well as to ensure that only written requests for assistance
would be considered by the Commission.

11. This Bill also seeks to increase the punishments provided for in subsections
36(3), 38(5) and 43(2) from a maximum fine of fifty thousand ringgit to a
maximum fine of one million ringgit and, in the case of a term of imprisonment,
from a maximum term of three years to a maximum term of five years. These
amendments are proposed in clauses 5, 7 and 11.

12. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ **_IMPLICATIONS_**

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN.(U[2])2101.]
