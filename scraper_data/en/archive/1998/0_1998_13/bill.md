EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to make new and better provisions to regulate the
converging communications and multimedia industries.

OVERVIEW

2. The scope of the proposed Communications and Multimedia
Act 1998 ("the Act") covers communications over the electronic
media but not the print media. It also does not affect the general
application of existing laws on national security, illegal content,
defamation and copyright. Such laws are still applicable to all forms
of content, regardless of the medium.

3. The Act does not encroach on the scope of other existing legislation
regulating traditional media and content services. It does, however,
over-ride some specific provisions relevant to traditional media which
would otherwise have limiting or counterproductive impact on the
development of the communications and multimedia industry.

4. The Act establishes a framework for regulatory intervention to

promote Malaysia's national policy objectives for the communications
and multimedia industry. This is an evolving industry in which a
range of traditionally stand alone industries are converging.

5. The activities and services regulated under this Act include

traditional broadcasting, telecommunications, and online services,
including the facilities and networks used in providing such services,
as well as the content which is supplied via the facilities and networks.

6. The Act seeks to provide a generic set of regulatory provisions
based on generic definitions of market and service activities and


-----

**_Communications and Multimedia_** 141

services. While the communications and multimedia industry may
encompass both networked and non-networked services and activities,
the jurisdiction of this Act is restricted to networked services and
activities only.

7. The key participants in the industry who are regulated under the
Act include the following:

— network facilities providers, who are the owners of facilities

such as satellite earth stations, broadband fibre optic cables,
telecommunications lines and exchanges,

radiocommunications transmission equipment, mobile
communications base stations, and broadcasting transmission

towers and equipment;

— network services providers, who provide the basic
connectivity and bandwidth to support a variety of
applications;

— applications service providers, who provide particular
functions such as voice services, data services, content-
based services, electronic commerce and other transmission
services; and

— content applications service providers who are a special

subset of applications service providers including traditional
broadcast services and newer services such as online
publishing and information services.

8. The Act is arranged in a modular structure. according to the
different types of regulatory interventions required, as follows:


-----

**142** **_Bill_**

_9. Part I of the Act sets out the objects of the legislation and_
provides definitions of the terms used in the Act.

10. Parts II to V of the Act establish the powers of the Minister

and a new regulatory Commission and an Appeal Tribunal, and sets
out procedures for the exercise of these powers.

11. Part VI of the Act establishes the framework for the economic

regulation of the communications and multimedia industry, including
the control of market entry through licensing, general safeguards to
promote fair and sustainable competition in the industry and specific
transitional safeguards. In addition, provisions for access to connectivity
services ensure that industry participants at each level of the industry
value chain have access to the facilities and services needed to
deliver their own services.

12. Part VII of the Act addresses the requirements for technical

regulation of the industry, including the assignment of limited resources
(spectrum, numbering and electronic addressing) and also provides
a framework to ensure the safety, security and integrity of
network services and applications services through technical codes
and standards.

13. Part VIII of the Act sets out the framework for the protection

and promotion of consumer interests.

14. Part IX of the Act provides the framework for social regulation,

including the promotion of local content, cultural diversity and

adherence to prevailing community standards.

15. Part X of the Act provides for general matters.

16. Part XI of the Act establishes arrangements and procedures for

the transition from the current regulatory regime to the new regime
established under the Act. The Act repeals the Telecommunications
Act 1950 and the Broadcasting Act 1988.

PART I

17. Part I of the Act seeks to provide for the short title and

commencement of the Act. It also sets out the objects of the Act,
which are to promote the ten national policy objectives for the

communications and multimedia industry and to establish the necessary
licensing framework and regulatory powers and procedures.


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 143

18. Part I further seeks to establish the extra-territorial application

of the Act which is necessary to ensure that the regime applies to
providers outside Malaysia who provide services to, from, or within,
Malaysia (for example, by satellite), and to the activities of licensees
in international markets which may have effects in Malaysia. The
Minister is empowered to exempt certain persons, places, premises
or geographical areas from the provisions of the Act.

19. Part I also defines particular words or terms for the purposes

of the Act.

PARTS II TO V

20. Parts II to V of the Act establish the powers of the Minister

and the Commission, based on specific regulatory instruments, and
also establish a mechanism for the appeal of certain decisions
made pursuant to the Act. The structure of the Ministerial and
Commission's powers and instruments is shown in the diagram
below:


-----

#### 144 Bill

_Ministerial powers and procedures:_

21. Part II establishes the Minister's powers and sets out the
procedures that must be followed by the Minister in issuing particular
subordinate instruments ("instruments") and executing such powers.
All instruments issued by the Minister must be consistent with the
objects and provisions of the Act. Instruments must be made public,
and maintained in relevant public registers by the Commission, in
order to promote transparency of the regulatory regime. This Act
includes procedures for the variation or repeal of any instrument.
Instruments which may be issued by the Minister include directions
to the Commission, determination of a matter, grant of licence,
declaration of licence conditions, and regulations.

_Direction to the Commission: The Minister may direct the_
Commission with respect to the Commission's exercise of its
powers and performance of its functions and obligations under
the Act.

_Determination of a matter: The Minister may determine matters_
under the Act. A determination may be made entirely at the
discretion of the Minister, subject to the provisions of the Act,
and does not require consultation with the Commission or any
other person.

_Grant of licences: The Minister has ultimate discretion with_
respect to the granting of licences under the Act, but must give
due consideration to the relevant recommendation of the
Commission.

_Declaration of licence conditions: The Minister may declare_
licence conditions and may vary or revoke licence conditions
with respect to licences granted under this Act such as individual
licences and class licences. The Minister must consult with
affected licensees prior to declaring, varying or revoking a
licence condition. Procedures for consultation ate provided in
the Act.

_Regulations: The Act empowers the Minister to make any_
regulations as may be necessary to give full effect to the Act.

22. The extensive and robust provisions relating to powers and

procedures under the Act are important for the following reasons:

— firstly, the regulatory framework places strong reliance on
instruments to provide for specific regulatory provisions
which are expected, and need, to change over time;

— secondly, it is important to establish and enable a framework

that is forward-looking and that is not quickly overtaken
by the pace of industry change;


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 145

— thirdly, there needs to be a clear and transparent framework

to promote investor confidence in the approaches to policy
management and administration and to minimise sources
of uncertainty.

_Appeal Tribunal:_

23. Part III of the Act seeks to establish an independent Appeal

Tribunal ("Tribunal") which has the power to review the merits of
decisions or directions of the Commission upon appeal by a person
affected by such decisions or directions. A determination by the
Commission is not appealable to the Tribunal. The rationale for the
establishment of the Tribunal are—

— to provide an expert review body, which provides the

industry with an avenue of merit not available through
court proceedings;

— to promote transparency and eliminate the pressures on the
Minister to review detailed administrative decisions; and

— to provide a fast and low cost avenue of appeal.

24. The Act provides that members of the Tribunal may be appointed

for a number of years, not exceeding three years, but the Tribunal

shall only meet on an ad hoc basis as and when it is required to
preside over any appeal lodged.

25. The members of the Tribunal are appointed by the Minister

and must include a Chairman (who is a Judge of the High Court)
and at least two other members. Clause 22 provides that the quorum
for the Tribunal shall be a minimum of three persons or a maximum
of five persons (including the Chairman).

26. Part III further sets out the procedures for the resignation or

termination of appointment of members. It also establishes certain
criteria and qualifications which members of the Tribunal must meet.
It also seeks to establish procedures for the Tribunal's decision-
making and to empower the Minister to determine the operating
procedures for the Tribunal.

27. Part IV of the Act seeks to establish procedures for the grant

of licences by the Minister. These are standard, procedures which
must be followed in relation to the administration of any licence
granted under the various Parts of the Act.

28. The Act provides for two types of licences, namely individual

licences and class licences. The licensing provisions under the Act
are designed to allow flexibility with respect to licensing structures
as the licensing requirements vary over time with the evolution of


-----

#### 146 Bill

the communications and multimedia industry. The power to decide
which type of licence is to be used for a particular type of activity
is exercisable at the discretion of the Minister.

29. Standard licence conditions apply to both individual and class
licences. These conditions are set out in the Schedule to the Act. All

licences must contain the relevant standard conditions. Special or
additional licence conditions only apply in respect of individual
licences and such licence conditions are declared by the Minister.

30. The Minister may not grant an individual licence to a person

where the activities for which the individual licence is requested are
subject to a class licence. This is to ensure that a person may not
operate under both an individual licence and a class licence with

respect to the same activity.

31. Persons seeking an individual licence under the Act must submit

a written application to the Commission. The Commission is required
to process the application and provide a recommendation to the
Minister as to whether an individual licence should be granted.

32. The Minister must give a written notice of the granting of an

individual licence setting out (by declaration) any special or additional
conditions to which the individual licence shall be subject. The
Minister must also give written notice of a refusal to grant an individual
licence including the reasons for the refusal.

, 33. Part IV seeks to empower the Minister to vary or revoke individual

licence conditions at any time, provided that the procedures set out
in this Part, for notifying the licensee and permitting the licensee
to appeal regarding the proposed variation or revocation, are followed.

34. A licensee may surrender his individual licence at any time by
written notice to the Minister. The Commission may recommend to
the Minister that an individual licence be cancelled in certain
circumstances which are specified in this Part. The Minister may
cancel an individual licence by declaration but must give the licensee
the opportunity to appeal against the proposed cancellation or provide
reasons for his alleged conduct or position. An individual licence
may not be assigned, sub-licensed or transferred to any other party
unless the prior written approval of the Minister has been granted.

35. In order to promote transparency of the regulatory regime, the
Minister must provide a copy of all individual licences granted
under the Act and related decisions issued under this Part, including
individual licence conditions, declarations of variations or revocations
of individual licence provisions and notices of surrender or cancellation,
to the Commission. The Commission must maintain registers of
these individual licences and related decisions. The Minister may
grant a class licence in respect of any matter requiring a licence


-----

#### Communications and Multimedia 147

under the Act. A person who wishes to operate under a class licence
must submit a notice of registration to the Commission, if required
under the Act. Registration simply enables the Commission to monitor
industry activity. A requirement to register under a class licence
does not imply any requirement for approval.

_Powers and procedures of the Malaysian Communications and_
_Multimedia Commission:_

36. Part V of the Act seeks to establish the Commission's powers
and set out the procedures that must be followed by the Commission
in issuing particular instruments arid executing such powers. All
instruments issued by the Commission must be consistent with the
objects and provisions of the Act. Instruments must be made public,
and maintained in relevant public registers by the Commission, in
order to promote transparency of the regulatory regime. The Act
includes procedures for the variation or repeal of any instrument.

_Instruments, powers and procedures:_

37. Part V of the Act further seeks to establish the powers of the

Commission to do all things as are necessary for the performance
of any of the Commission's functions. In addition, the Commission
may authorise any of its employees, or appoint a person who is not
an officer or employee of the Commission, to perform any of its
functions or exercise any of its powers.

38. Specific instruments which may be issued by the Commission,
and the procedures which the Commission may undertake include
directions, determination, and inquiry.

_Directions: The Commission may issue written directions to_
persons where the Act provides for it, including licensees about
compliance or non-compliance with licence conditions. Before
issuing a direction, the Commission must first provide a formal
warning to the person and allow the person an opportunity to
be heard or submit a written submission in defence of his
conduct.

_Determination: The Commission may determine any matter_
specified in the Act as being subject to determination. The
Commission may undertake a public inquiry prior to a
determination only if the matter to be determined is of significant
public or industry interest. The inquiry must then be carried
out in accordance with the standard procedures for a public
inquiry set out under the Act.

_Inquiry: The Commission may hold a public inquiry regarding_
any matter which relates to the administration of the Act or its
subsidiary legislation. A public inquiry may be launched by


-----

**148** **_Bill_**

the Commission on its own initiative, or by a request from a
person. Alternatively, the Minister may direct the Commission
to conduct a public inquiry. A public inquiry will generally
involve the Commission's announcement of the inquiry and
call for submissions in respect of the matters being examined.

39. The Commission may report and make a determination as soon

as it wishes after the minimum forty-five days of the consultation

period.

_Investigations:_

40. The Act seeks to empower the Commission to undertake an

investigation about any matter pertaining to the administration of the
Act or its subsidiary legislation. An investigation may be triggered
by a complaint made by a person or a direction from the Minister.
In addition, the Commission may itself initiate an investigation
about a relevant matter.

41. The Act provides specific procedures for the conduct of an

investigation under the Act, including -

— the duty of the Commission to assist a person to formulate
a complaint;

— the requirement for the Commission to notify a respondent
about the complaint;

— the requirement to provide a complainant or respondent
with an opportunity to make submissions about matters
under investigation; and

— the preparation and publication of reports about an
investigation.

_Information-gathering powers:_

42. The Act seeks to empower the Commission to direct a person

to provide any information it may require for the purposes of carrying
out its powers and functions under the Act or its subsidiary legislation.
It is an offence under the Act for a person to provide false or
misleading information, documents or evidence. Record-keeping rules
may be made to apply to one or more licensees or persons. The
Commission may also, at its discretion, and following consideration
of the commercial interests of parties to whom the information
relates, publish information received in the course of exercising its
powers and functions. This provision is intended to promote
transparency and to reduce information asymmetries which may
exist between providers and other interested parties in the industry.


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 149

_Dispute resolution:_

43. The Act seeks to provide that disputes between persons about

matters under the Act should first be resolved by negotiations. If one
of the parties to a dispute has made an undertaking with respect to
the matter under dispute, the parties may decide to adopt the provisions
of the undertaking. However, if the parties cannot resolve a dispute
and one party does not wish to adopt the conditions of an undertaking,
the parties may seek resolution of the dispute by the Commission
if the Act or its subsidiary legislation specifically provides for such
resolution. The Act empowers the Commission to decide disputes
which have been notified. The Commission must register its decision
about a dispute and the decision may be enforced by the Commission.

_Registration of agreements;_

44. The Act provides that parties to an agreement must apply to

the Commission for registration of the agreement if the Act so
requires. The Commission shall only register an agreement if it is
consistent with the objects and provisions of the Act, and any relevant
instruments and subsidiary legislation made under the Act. The
purpose of the requirement to register agreements is to ensure that
any agreement reached between parties regarding matters under the
Act are consistent with the objects and provisions of the Act and to
preclude agreements between parties which may be detrimental to
other providers. The Commission must maintain a register containing
certain information about the agreements, but not the terms and
conditions of the agreements. If an agreement which requires registration
has not been registered, that agreement is unenforceable.

_Industry forums, voluntary industry codes, undertakings and mandatory_
_standards:_

45. The Act seeks to establish a regime of industry self-regulation,

supported by fallback regulatory safeguards which may be administered
by the Commission.

46. The forums and processes are not novel. Current arrangements

rely heavily on industry-based advisory committees and consultative
processes. This Part formalises these processes to enable a more
robust structural framework to underpin the emphasis on greater
industry self-regulation and self-discipline. The provisions need to
be set out in a way that allows for Government intervention where
industry self-discipline or compliance with undertakings has
demonstrably failed.

47. Part V of the Act seeks to establish the general powers and

procedures relating to the establishment of industry forums, voluntary
industry codes, undertakings and mandatory standards. These powers


-----

#### 150 Bill

and procedures are applied in the areas of Economic, Technical,
Consumer and Social regulation. The diagram below illustrates the
processes and relationship associated with industry forums and
voluntary industry codes:

_Industry forums and industry codes:_

48. The Commission has powers to "designate" or to appoint industry

forums which will be responsible for the formulation of voluntary
industry codes regarding a matter dealt with by that code, particularly
an offence provision. For example, compliance with a registered
content code will provide a legal defence against any prosecution
regarding the provision of offensive or indecent content.

49. The fact that the code provides a defence against the basic

offence provision gives a strong incentive for the industry to form
forums and develop voluntary codes and comply with them. While
there is no requirement to comply with the code, failure to comply
will require a licensee to make his own defence in the event of any
action or proceeding against him.

50. If a satisfactory voluntary industry code is not developed by

an industry forum and the Commission is of the opinion that such
code will not be developed, the Commission itself may determine
a code regarding the relevant matter. This is a regulatory safeguard
and is not intended to be applied in the first instance. The Commission
must follow the normal procedures for a determination, that is, it
must undertake a public inquiry (where appropriate) about the code
before determining the code. This process is designed to ensure that
there will be industry input to a code developed by the Commission.


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 151

51. The Commission may direct a person or a class of persons to

comply with the provisions of a code. In such case, compliance will
be mandatory because of the enforceability of the direction, but only
for those licensees subject to the direction. The provision is intended
to be applied in the event that one or a few licensees subject to a
voluntary industry code are, in the view of the Commission, committing
an offence. This provides an alternative to the process of launching
an action or proceeding against the licensee or licensees.

52. The Commission may revoke a voluntary industry code if it

is satisfied that the code is no longer consistent with the objects or
provisions of the Act, or with any relevant instrument. A new code
would then be developed as described above. Any industry forum
may at any time submit a new code for registration. A code that is
modified or varied is taken to be a new code.

_Mandatory standards:_

53. It is the intention of the Act that the primary reliance shall be

on industry self-regulation. However, if the Commission is of the
view that a voluntary industry code is ineffective in achieving the
objects of the Act or any relevant instrument or provision of the Act,
the Commission may determine a mandatory standard. The Minister
may also direct the Commission to determine a mandatory standard.
These are fallback regulatory safeguards.

54. The Commission must determine a standard according to the

procedures set out in the Act, that is, the Commission may undertake
a public inquiry (where appropriate) regarding the mandatory standard
before determining the standard. A standard developed by the
Commission must be consistent with the Act or its subsidiary legislation
and any relevant instrument. Compliance with a mandatory standard
by any person who is subject to the standard is mandatory, and
provides a legal defence in the same way as a voluntary industry
code.

55. The Commission may vary a mandatory standard at any time

if the standard is no longer consistent with the objects or provisions
of the Act or its subsidiary legislation and any relevant instrument.
A mandatory standard that is modified or varied is taken to be a new
mandatory standard.

56. A civil penalty in the form of a fine is imposed by the Commission

if a person fails to comply with a direction issued by the Commission
regarding compliance with a voluntary industry code or a mandatory
standard.

_Undertakings:_

57. Under Chapter 11 of Part V, a person who is subject to an

individual licence or a class licence under the Act may provide an


-----

#### 152 Bill

undertaking to the Commission regarding any matter which may be
subject to a voluntary industry code or regarding any other matter
where the Act makes express provision for an undertaking to be
provided.

58. An undertaking is an agreement by the person to meet particular

conditions, to perform particular actions, or to provide services on
particular terms and conditions without discrimination. An undertaking
may set out original terms and conditions or it may adopt the terms

and conditions of a relevant registered voluntary industry code. An
undertaking must be registered by the Commission before it can be
enforced.

59. The Commission shall only register an undertaking if it is

consistent with the objects and provisions of the Act. and with any
relevant instrument. However, the Commission must register an
undertaking if that undertaking only adopts the terms and conditions
of a registered voluntary industry code.

60. A person who provides an undertaking may modify, vary or

replace the undertaking at any time. However, such modification,
variation or replacement of the undertaking must be registered according
to the same procedures as the original undertaking. An undertaking
is enforceable in a court of law and either the Commission or any
person may apply to the court for the enforcement of a registered
undertaking.

_Regulatory forbearance:_

61. The Act provides that the Minister may, upon recommendation

by the Commission, direct the Commission to forbear from applying
any provision in the Act to a licensee or class of licensees, or a
person or class of persons. This may occur if the Minister determines
that the enforcement of the provision of the Act or its subsidiary
legislation is no longer necessary to ensure the objects of the Act,
and is not necessary for the protection of consumers, and the
forbearance is consistent with the national interest, and the
forbearance will not impede the administration of the Act.

62. The purpose of the forbearance provisions under the Act is to

provide flexibility to the Act as the communications and multimedia
industry evolves over time. In a rapidly changing industry, certain
provisions of the Act may become irrelevant either generally or with
respect to particular persons regulated under the Act.

63. The Commission may conduct a public inquiry before making

a determination to make a recommendation to the Minister about
regulatory forbearance. This is to ensure that there is industry input
to such decision. The inquiry may be initiated by the Commission


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 153

itself, in response to a written request by a person or class of persons,
or in response to a direction from the Minister. A decision by the
Minister to forbear from applying any provision under the Act or
its subsidiary legislation shall be published as an exemption order
in the Gazette.

_Review of decisions:_

64. A person who is aggrieved or adversely affected by any decision

of the Commission may request the Commission to provide a statement
of reasons for the decision. The Commission must provide such
statement which shall state the reasons for the decision and include
any relevant information taken into account in reaching the decision
(except for material or information that is of a confidential nature
or is likely to prejudice the fair trial of a person).

65. A person who is aggrieved or adversely affected by any direction

or decision by the Commission may appeal to the Tribunal for a
review of the merits and the process of the decision. The Minister
may determine matters under the Act which are not subject to appeal
to the Tribunal.

66. A person affected by a decision or any other action of the

Commission or the Minister under the Act may apply to the court
for a judicial review.

_Regulatory review:_

67. Chapter 14 of Part V seeks to provide that the Commission

shall review all rules and regulations made under the Act that are
in effect at the time of the review. The review must be undertaken
every three years, or as and when directed by the Minister. The
purpose of this provision is to ensure the regular review of detailed
rules and regulations which may become irrelevant due to technological
changes or other changes as the sector develops and matures.

_Reporting to the Minister:_

68. The Act imposes obligations on the Commission to report on

significant matters regarding the performance of network facilities
providers, network service providers, applications service providers
and content applications service providers. The purpose of Chapter

15 of Part V is to ensure the ongoing monitoring of the performance

of the industry against policy objectives. A report by the Commission
under this Chapter must be published, ensuring transparency by
making information about the industry available to the public.


-----

**154** **_Bill_**

PART VI

69. Part VI of the Act seeks to establish a framework for the

economic regulation of the communications and multimedia industry.
The purposes of the economic regulatory interventions are to promote
consumer markets which offer choice, quality and affordability,
any-to-any connectivity, competition in markets and investment and
innovation in the sector. The diagram below outlines the overall
structure of Part VI and shows the main areas of responsibility for
both the Minister and the Commission:

70. Within the economic regulation module of the Act there are

three primary Chapters: licensing of market participants, general
competition practices, and regulation of access to services. These
are discussed below.

_Licensing:_

71. Chapter 1 of Part VI establishes the licensing requirements of

the industry. The objective of this Chapter is to both control and
monitor the entry of network facilities providers and network service
providers into the market, and to ensure that all facilities and services
are provided in accordance with national policy. In addition, licensing
allows the imposition of various conditions on market participation.


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 155

72. Subject to such exemptions as may be determined by the Minister,

the Act precludes the ownership of network facilities, or the provision
of network services, or the provision of applications services except
under and in accordance with an individual licence or a class licence
granted by the Minister under the Act. The Act does not prescribe
a specific licensing structure. Rather it allows the Minister flexibility
to grant either individual licences or class licences for particular
types of activities as the Minister deems fit. This flexibility is designed
to ensure that the Act remains responsible to changing requirements
as the industry evolves.

73. Part VI of the Act allows the Minister to declare that a licensed

network facilities provider, other than the owner of any network
facilities, is the nominated facilities provider for the network facilities
for the purposes of the Act if such nomination will not impede the
objects or the efficient administration of the Act. This provision will
enable infrastructure ordinarily used by its owner for non-public
purposes to be used by a nominated network facilities provider to
provide services to the public thereby promoting the efficient use
of resources. This provision will also allow for financing arrangements
which may otherwise require the financier to be licensed under the
Act.

74. Part VI specifically exempts any applications service provider

who is not subject to a class licence from the prohibitions under the
Act. This Part confirms that some applications service providers
may not be subject to individual licences and also envisages that
some applications service providers will not require a licence under
the Act. The purpose of the provisions in this Part is to exclude small
applications service providers or persons who may inadvertently fall
within the definition of an applications service provider from the
licensing requirements under the Act.

75. Part VI of the Act provides for three categories of competition

regulation, which apply to a communications market. A communications
market has been defined to be an economic market for—

— network services;

— applications services;

— goods and services used in conjunction with the above; or

— access to network facilities used in conjunction with either
a network service or an applications service.

76. The general competition practices provided in the Act are new

provisions. The purposes of these provisions are—

— to provide protection for smaller providers in the absence

of a general competitive policy or trade practices regulatory
regime;


-----

#### 156 Bill

_—_ to provide a context for, and certainty about, the manner

in which the general powers and procedures under the Act
should be administered. This reinforces the regulatory intent
of the national policy for the development of the
communications and multimedia industry; and

— to establish a framework and clear powers for the Commission
to ensure that anti-competitive practices do not undermine
the national policy.

77. Part VI expressly—

— prohibits any conduct by any licensee who has the purpose

of substantially lessening competition in a communications
market;

— prohibits arrangements and practices such as rate fixing,

market-sharing and boycotts; and

— prohibits mandatory tying or linking arrangements regarding

the provision or supply of products and services.

78. The Act also provides for the Commission to publish guidelines
which will apply when making assessments about "substantial lessening
of competition".

79. Part VI also seeks to confer specific powers of direction on the

Commission with respect to conduct by a licensee who is in a
dominant position in a market. The Commission may determine that
a licensee is in a dominant position in a market, and may publish
guidelines which it will apply in making such determination. However,
the Act makes no initial assumption that any licensee is in a dominant
position in any communications market in Malaysia.

80. The Commission may direct a licensee who is—

— in a dominant position in a communications market; and

— engaging in conduct which has or may have the effect of
substantially lessening competition in a communications
market,

to cease the conduct and implement any appropriate remedies.

81. Part VI further seeks to provide that the Minister may make

rules in relation to agreements between licensees and foreign network
facilities providers and/or network service providers. This Part is
designed to preclude foreign providers from acting in a manner that
is detrimental to competition in the domestic market or damaging
to local licensees.


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 157

_Access to services: access list and standard access obligations:_

82. Chapter 3 of Part VI of the Act seeks to establish a regime

to ensure that all network facilities providers, network service providers
and applications service providers can gain access to the necessary
facilities and services on reasonable terms and conditions in order
to prevent the inhibition of the provision of downstream services.

83. The services which are included in the access list and subject

to standard access obligations, and the regulation of access to such
services, will and must change over time. Accordingly, the arrangements
set out in this Part are designed to be flexible and robust over time.

84. The access regime is illustrated in the diagram below:

85. The Act provides for the establishment of an access list of

network facilities, network services, and ancillary facilities and services
(such as billing and databases) which are considered essential to the
provision of network services or applications services. Facilities and
services may be placed in the access list (following the recommendation
by the access forum), or by determination (following a public inquiry,
where appropriate) by the Commission. (No inquiry is required in
relation to any facilities or services which are recommended by the
access forum because in formulating the recommendation the forum
must consult with interested parties who are present to give a unanimous
decision).

86. Standard access obligations apply to facilities and services

included in the access list. Standard access obligations include the


-----

#### 158 Bill

requirement for provision of access to any party that requests access
and that the first provider must provide access to the second provider
on at least the same technical standard and quality and on an equitable
and non-discriminatory basis. The obligation is therefore reciprocal.
Failure to comply with the standard access obligations is an offence.

87. The Minister may determine that an individual licensee or a
class of licensees is exempted from the standard access obligations.

_Access diputes:_

88. The Commission is empowered to resolve access disputes between

parties in accordance with its standard dispute resolution powers
under Part V of the Act.

_Access forum and access code:_

89. The Commission may designate an industry body to be the

access forum for the purposes of this Part, in accordance with Chapter
9 of Part V. The access forum should comprise industry representatives
who may be either seeking access or providing access to necessary
facilities and services. The primary responsibilities of the access
forum are to recommend services to be placed in the access list and
to prepare an access code for registration by the Commission. The
access code should provide model terms and conditions for access
to any or all of the facilities and services included in the access list.
The Commission may only register an access code if it is consistent
with the standard access obligations under the Act. The procedure
for designation of an access forum and preparation of an access code
is shown in the diagram below:


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 159

90. A licensee may provide an undertaking specifying the terms

and conditions on which he will provide access to a particular facility
or service in the access list. An undertaking shall be submitted in
accordance with the general provisions of Part V. The Commission
may only register an undertaking that is consistent with the standard
access obligations.

PART VII

91. Part VII of the Act establishes a framework to promote the

effectiveness of technical regulation by facilitating the technical
interoperability of networks, to promote the efficient allocation of
resources, and to promote the safety, security and integrity of network
services and applications services. The diagram below shows the
overall structure of Part VII and the areas of responsibility for both
the Minister and the Commission:

92. Within this overall structure, the substantive aspects of technical
regulation concern spectrum assignment, numbering and electronic
addressing and the setting of technical codes and standards. These
areas are discussed below.

_Spectrum assignment:_

93. Chapter 1 of this Part provides mechanisms to ensure the

efficient assignment of frequency spectrum. Chapter 1 prohibits any


-----

#### 160 Bill

person from using any part of the spectrum to supply a network
service unless—

— the person holds a spectrum assignment issued by the
Commission under this Part;

— the persons holds an apparatus assignment issued by the
Commission under this Part; or

— the use is subject to a class assignment issued by the
Commission under this Part.

94. Assignments of spectrum under this Part are undertaken by the
Commission. Any spectrum assignment, apparatus assignment or
class assignment issued must be consistent with the spectrum plan
developed by the Commission.

95. The Act provides for three types of assignments, namely, spectrum
assignments, apparatus assignments and class assignments, but allows
the Minister and the Commission flexibility in the administration of
different types of assignments for different purposes:

— a spectrum assignment authorises a person to use one or
more specified frequency bands for any purpose consistent
with the assignment conditions;

— an apparatus assignment authorises a person to use one or
more specified frequency bands to operate a network facility
of a specified kind or for a specified purpose;

— a class assignment authorises use by any person of a specified
frequency band for a specified purpose.

96. The term "'assignment" is used rather than the term "licence"
in order to convey the distinction between the assignment of rights
and the licensing of an activity. While the Commission may assign
rights to a person to use spectrum, the ultimate ownership of spectrum
remains with the Government. In addition, the provision that the Act
makes for tradeable rights for the use of spectrum is difficult to
reconcile with the concept of a single licence, which cannot be
subdivided.

97. It is envisaged that the Minister would determine spectrum to
be assigned as a tradeable spectrum assignment in frequency bands
if there is significant technological uncertainty about the ultimate
use of the band. The secondary market in tradeable rights would
subsequently allocate the band to its most efficient use.


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 161

98. Apparatus assignments may allow the holder of the assignment

to authorise a third party to operate a network facility in accordance
with the assignment.

99. The Act provides that the Minister may determine spectrum to
be used for spectrum assignments only. Spectrum which has been
determined by the Minister for spectrum assignment may not be
allocated by means of an apparatus assignment or a class assignment.

100. _Clause 174 seeks to enable the Minister to determine preferential_

rights of access to spectrum. The purpose of this provision is to
establish a linkage between spectrum assignment and the licensing
structures for network facilities and network services. Operators or
providers who hold individual licences may be granted preferential
rights of access to spectrum in the context of special undertakings
made by the licensee. This is part of the regulatory incentive system
intrinsic to securing the objects of the Act.

101. Chapter 1 of Part VII seeks to provide that the Commission

may develop a spectrum plan for use and assignment of one or more
parts of the spectrum. The spectrum plan may define the methodology
for assignment and reassignments by auction, tender or at a fixed
rate or price. The spectrum plan may also include a conversion plan
for the conversion of designated apparatus assignments into spectrum
assignments.

102. The Act also seeks to provide for the compulsory acquisition

by the Commission of assignments in a band determined for spectrum
assignments upon the direction of the Minister. The Commission
may pay a reasonable amount of compensation to a holder of an
assignment who is forced to surrender his assignment before its
expiry by a compulsory acquisition.

_Numbering and electronic addressing:_

103. The Commission is vested with the control, planning,

administration and management of the numbering and electronic
addressing of network services and applications services that are
provided to the public. The Act requires the Commission to develop
a numbering and electronic addressing plan setting out rules about
matters relating to the use, transfer, assignment and portability of
numbers and electronic addresses.

104. The Act seeks to empower the Commission to appoint a

person to manage the allocation of numbering and/or electronic
addressing. The Commission may also appoint a person to maintain
an integrated public number database and may delegate its responsibility
to maintain a register of allocated numbers to a designated authority.

162 _Bill_

_Technical standards:_

105. Under the Act it is an offence to use any technical equipment

or systems which hinder network interoperability or compromise
public safety.

_Technical standards forums, technical codes and standards:_

106. The Commission may designate one or more industry forums

under this Part in accordance with its general powers under Part V
of the Act.

107. A technical standards forum designated under this Part shall

be responsible for the preparation of a technical code regarding a
particular matter or matters. Matters which may be dealt with under
technical codes are listed in the Act:

108. A technical code is subject to the standard provisions relating

to industry codes under Part V of the Act, including the provisions
on mandatory standards.

109. Part VII of the Act seeks to provide that the Commission may

register certifying agencies or classes of certifying agencies for the
purposes of certifying compliance with codes under this Part.

_Communications and Multimedia_ 163

PART VIII

110. Part VIII of the Act establishes a framework for protection

and promoting the interests of consumers and multimedia services.
The diagram below illustrates the structure of the framework for
consumer regulation:

111. Part VIII of the Act makes it an offence for licensed network

service providers and applications service providers to deal
unreasonably with consumers or fail to provide mechanisms for
redress. It is intended that the voluntary industry codes will set out
model procedures for meeting consumer requirements.

_Consumer forum and consumer codes:_

112. Part VIII of the Act seeks to provide for the power of the

Commision to designate an industry body to be the consumer forum.
The consumer forum will be responsible for developing one or more
consumer codes dealing with matters relating to the protection and
promotion of consumer interests including, but not limited to, the
matters listed in the Act.

113. Under the standard licence conditions applicable to all licensees,

compliance with a relevant registered consumer code is mandatory.
While compliance with codes is generally voluntary, the relative
weakness of consumers justifies a more direct approach.


-----

114. A consumer code is subject to the standard provisions relating

to industry codes under Part V of the Act, including the provisions
on mandatory standards.

_Required applications services:_

115. Part VIII of the Act also seeks to establish the power of the

Commission to direct a licensee or a class of licensees to provide
certain required applications services which the Commission may
consider are essential services for consumers, for example, emergency
services.

_Consumer complaint and dispute resolution:_

116. Part VIII of the Act establishes the duty of the Commission

to assist in resolving consumer complaints and provides that the
Commission may use any or all of its powers to do this. The Commission
is required to establish procedures for handling consumer complaints.
It is envisaged that the Commission would exercise these arrangements
when any industry-based redress scheme has failed to resolve a
consumer dispute in a satisfactory manner.

_Rate regulation:_

117. The Act seeks to establish a framework for the regulation of

rates. Clause 197 provides that providers may set their rates according
to the market rates. The principles on rate setting are spelt out in
_clause 198. However, whenever necessary, the Minister may intervene,_
for good cause or in the public interest, to set the rates for any
competitive facilities or services provided. The Minister is also
empowered under clause 200 to determine special rate regulation


-----

#### Communications and Multimedia 165

regimes for a particular group of persons or for a particular area. The
Minister may also make rules to prescribe matters about rates including,
but not limited to, the level of rates charged, variation of rates,
publication or disclosure of rates, and rate control arrangements (for
example, rate capping arrangements). The rules may relate to specified
or classes of network facilities, network services, applications services
(for example, voice application services) or content applications
services and/or to specified licensees or classes of licensees.

_Universal service provision:_

118. Part VIII also seeks to provide a framework for the establishment

of a system of universal service provision which is designed to
encourage the rollout of new facilities and the availability of services,
particularly in areas which the Commission considers are "underserved
areas" or are "underserved groups within the community". Provision
is made for supplementary measures, including the establishment
and operation of a Universal Service Provision Fund that can
be invoked if industry undertakings faii to be sufficiently
comprehensive.

PART IX

119. Part IX of the Act seeks to provide a regulatory framework

which is designed to promote—

— the growth and development of content applications services
reflecting Malaysia's cultural diversity;

— the widespread availability of content applications services
reflecting Malaysia's cultural diversity; and

— adherence to community standards by content applications

service providers.

120. It is intended that the regulatory measures under this Part will

be administered in a manner that reflects their degree of influence
in forming community views and standards. Hence the provisions
of this Part allow the Minister and the Commission considerable
flexibility in their application. This flexibility is necessary as, while
it may be necessary to regulate certain content applications services
which have a high degree of influence on a substantial proportion
of the population, there are many content applications services which
will require minimal, if any, direct regulation.


-----

#### 166 Bill

121. The following diagram shows the major areas addressed under

social regulation in the Act and the main areas of responsibility for
both the Minister and the Commission:

122. Within this overall structure, the substantive aspects of social

regulation seek to deal with licensing, content requirements and
content codes. These areas are discussed below.

_Licensing:_

123. Part IX of the Act establishes a framework for the licensing

of content applications service providers. Subject to such exemptions
as may be determined by the Minister under the Act, no person may
provide a content applications service unless the person holds an
individual licence granted under this Part or the content applications

service is subject to a class licence granted under this Part. A person
who holds a licence under this Part is not exempted from the requirement
to hold another licence in respect of other relevant activities under

the Act.

124. The provision of content in the course of providing another

service (that is, "content incidental to the service provided") is
exempted from this Part.

125. The Minister may also determine guidelines to clarify the

meaning of "content incidental to the service provided". This is to
ensure that services which may unintentionally meet the definition
of "content applications service" and which do not require regulation
are exempted from the licensing requirements under this Part. An
example of such a service is a World Wide Web site which uses a
graphical interface (technically "content") to provide financial services.


-----

#### Communications and Multimedia 167

126. "Closed content applications services" are also exempted,

and are initially defined as services confined to a dwelling or a body
corporate. There is provision for the Minister to alter the definition
at any time.

127. In addition to the above exemptions, a person who provides

a limited content applications service, defined, in clause 6, as a
service of limited appeal, is not required to hold an individual licence.
The Minister may determine guidelines which clarify the meaning
of "limited content applications service".

128. The Commission shall provide an opinion on the category of

a limited content applications service upon request by a person.

129. The objective of these provisions is to ensure that content

applications services which do not require extensive social regulation
under this Part, because they are provided only to limited sectors of
the population, are not subject to unnecessary regulation. A high

level of regulation of these services is likely to impede the development
of local content providers and therefore be inconsistent with the
objects of the Act.

130. As with the other licensing provisions under the Act, the

provisions for the licensing of the content applications service are
not prescriptive with respect to the types of licences for different
types of services.The absence of prescriptive licensing provisions in
this Part is principally to allow flexibility with respect to the licensing
of different types of content applications service providers depending
on their degree of influence in forming community views and standards.

For example, while a television broadcaster may be most appropriately
subject to an individual licence, another content applications service
provider whose services appeal to only a small class may only be
subject to a class licence. There is an extremely wide range of
content applications service providers, many of whom may not require
any form of licensing at all.

_Content requirements:_

131. It will be an offence to provide content which is offensive,

indecent, obscene, false or menacing. It is intended that codes addressing
these matters will be developed under this Part.

_Content forums and content codes:_

132. The Commission may designate one or more industry forums

under this Part in accordance with its general powers to designate
an industry forum under Part V.


-----

133. A content forum designated under this Part shall be responsible

for the preparation of a content code about a particular matter or
matters. Matters which may be dealt with under a content code
include, but are not limited to, the matters listed in the Act. In
general, the intention of content codes is to restrict the provision of
unsuitable content.

134. There may be multiple content forums and multiple content

codes, as a content code may relate to—

— a particular matter;

— a particular type of content applications service provider;
or

— a particular matter for a particular type of content applications
service provider.

135. The provisions relating to content codes under the Act allow

flexibility in this respect because, while a content applications service
provider who provides any content applications services which are
of broad appeal to the general population may require reasonably
prescriptive guidelines as to the type of content which may be provided,
an applications service provider who provides any applications service
which is of more limited appeal is unlikely to require as stringent
regulation.

136. A content code is subject to the standard provisions relating

to industry codes under Part V, including the provisions on mandatory
standards.

PART X

137. Part X seeks to deal with general provisions.


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 169

_Installation of network facilities, access to network facilities, etc.:_

138. Chapter 1 of Part X seeks to provide for the network facilities

provider to enter on land and do anything that is necessary for his
purposes.The provisions ensure that the provider must take all
reasonable steps to ensure that he causes as little damage and
inconvenience as is practicable. He is also under a duty to restore
the land. The provider is required to enter into an agreement with
a public utility if the activity undertaken by him is likely to affect
the operations of the utility.The provider is further required to give
written notice to the owner or occupier of the land before engaging
in his activities on the land.The notice must state that if a person
suffers financial loss or damage to property because of anything
done by the provider, compensation may be payable.

139. Provision is made to require the provider to ensure that any

network facilities installed over a road, bridge, path or navigable
water is installed in a way that will allow reasonable passage by
persons, vehicles and vessels.

140. The provider may apply to the Commission for a network

facilities installation permit authorising him to carry out the installation
of the facilities. Amongst other things, the provider must satisfy the
Commission that he has made reasonable efforts to negotiate in good
faith with each proprietor whose approval is required for carrying
out the installation and that at least one of those approvals has not
been obtained within fourteen days after the beginning of the
negotiations concerned.The necessary approval of the relevant State
Authority, local authority or other authority must be obtained first.

141. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, a

network facilities provider or a public utility shall provide a network
facilities provider with non-discriminatory access to any post, network
facilities or right-of-way owned or controlled by him.

**_Additional offences and penalties:_**

142. Chapter 2 of Part X seeks to provide for additional offences

and penalties not already dealt with in the Act. Amongst other
things, the Act makes it an offence for a person to intercept
communications without a legal authorisation, or to fraudulently use
or obtain any network facilities, network service, applications service
or content applications service. Adequate provisions are made to
include all cases of "cloning" of customer equipment or other device
to gain unauthorised access to services, and offences relating to the
tampering with or the use of equipment or software in order to
defraud.


-----

**170** **_Bill_**

_Powers of entry, investigation into offences and prosecution:_

143. Chapter 3 of Part X seeks to deal with the powers of entry

of authorised officers, investigation into offences and prosecution.

144. The Sessions Court shall have jurisdiction to try offences

under the Act.

_National interest matters:_

145. Part X of the Act also sets out various obligations regarding

the protection of national interest matters which may be imposed on
licensees.These include provisions for Government control of
communications in an emergency, and disaster recovery plans.

_Miscellaneous:_

146. Part X also seeks to deal with miscellaneous matters such as

the Minister's power to make rules on record-keeping, and the Minister's
direction to the Commission on interworking arrangements with
other authorities or any international organisation. Provision is also
made to state clearly that the Act prevails over any other relevant
written law to the extent of any inconsistency or conflict between
the Act and other Acts.

PART XI

147. Part XI of the Act seeks to establish arrangements and procedures

for the smooth transition from the current regulatory regime to the
new regime under the Act. The transitional provisions are summarised
in the diagram below:


-----

_Communications and Multimedia_ 171

148. Part XI repeals the Telecommunications Act 1950 and the

Broadcasting Act 1988 ("repealed Acts") from the appointed date,
that is, the date of coming into operation of the Act. The Act will
replace the provisions of these two earlier Acts.

149. The Act preserves any subsidiary legislation made under the

repealed Acts until new subsidiary legislation are made to replace
them.The Minister is empowered to make the necessary modifications
to such subsidiary legislation for the purposes of removing difficulties
or in consequence of the passing of the Act.

150. A person who holds an existing licence granted under the

repealed Acts may apply to the Commission for a new licence under
the Act. An old licence shall only be effective for twelve months
after the appointed date. The Minister may grant a new licence
which may be subject to any conditions that the Minister considers
are in the national interest.

151. If a licence granted under a repealed Act conflicts with a

class licence granted under the Communications and Multimedia
Act 1998, the licence granted under the repealed Acts shall have no
effect to the extent of the conflict.

152. A person who wishes to continue to operate under a licence

granted under the repealed Acts must register it with the Commission
within twelve months of the new Act coming into operation.

153. A person who is holding a licence granted under the repealed

Acts after the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 comes into
operation must indicate to the Minister in writing as to whether he
intends to seek a new licence under the new Act within twelve
months from the appointed date.

154. Persons operating under existing licences granted under the

repealed Acts are not entitled to receive any new benefits for which
the licensees may be eligible under the Act.

155. The transitional provisions relating to licensing are intended

to allow the Minister and the Commission to establish incentives for
existing licensees to move to new licences under the new licensing
regime. Such incentives may involve the application of other provisions
under the Act, including the general licensing provisions and provisions
on the universal service provision system.The incentives offered to
licensees should benefit the licensee as well as assist to further the
objects of the Act.The intention is that no licensee should be any
worse off under a new licence. The provisions ensure this by allowing
the existing licensees to choose whether and when (but not later than
twelve months) they wish to migrate to a new licence.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure,
the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN. (U[2]) 1995/VII.J
