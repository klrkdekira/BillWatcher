EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Labuan Offshore Financial Services
Authority Act 1996 ("Act 545").

2. Clause 1 deals with the short title and the commencement of the
proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act by expanding the
definition of "offshore financial services". The amendment is necessary
in order to ensure that laws enacted by Parliament subsequent to the
enactment of Act 545 are within the ambit of the definition.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 4 of the Act—_

_(a) by inserting a new subsection (4) to empower the Authority_

to establish and participate in any body corporate for the
purpose of promoting research and training and enhancing
the development of Labuan as an International Offshore
Financial Centre; and

_(b) by inserting a new subsection (5) to empower the Authority_

to issue directions especially to offshore banking and
insurance institutions, relating to the policy to be followed,
the manner of carrying on business, prudential practices
to be adhered to, and any other matter relating to the
supervision and regulation of offshore banking, fund
management, the insurance industry and other permitted
or regulated offshore financial activities.

## 14 Bill

_5. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 18 of the Act by introducing_
a new section 18A which empowers the Authority, with the approval
of the Minister of Finance, to create and maintain a "Staff Welfare
Fund" out of the funds of the Authority for the benefit of members
of its staff and their dependants.

6. Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new Part HA into the Act. The
proposed new Part contains sections 28A, 28B, 28C and 28D. The
amendment would empower the Authority to collect or receive any
information from the offshore players or any other person. The
information so obtained by the Authority shall be secret as between
the Authority and the person supplying it and any disclosure thereof
can only be made under the circumstances provided for in section
28B. At the same time, the Authority is empowered to appoint any
officer or employee of the Authority to examine offshore financial
institutions and to appoint investigating officers if the need arises.

7. Clause 7 seeks to insert a new section 32A to empower the
Authority, with the approval of the Minister, to impose fees which
are not provided for under any other law relating to offshore financial
services for services rendered by the Authority.

8. Clause 9 seeks to insert new sections 36A, 36B and 36c. The
proposed section 36A seeks to empower the Authority to appoint any
qualified officer or employee of the Authority to appear in court on
its behalf in civil proceedings. The proposed section 36B seeks to
confer upon the Director-General, subject to the consent of the
Public Prosecutor, the power to compound offences under Act 545.
The proposed section 36c deals with the liability of directors, officers
and controllers of any offshore financial institution if such institution
is convicted of an offence under Act 545.

9. Other amendments not specifically mentioned in this Statement

are minor and consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 2079.]
