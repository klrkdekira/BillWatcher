three new instances that would warrant a countervailing duty investigation to

is no sufficient evidence of subsidization or injury to justify proceeding with
the investigation, or that the amount of subsidy is de minimis or the volume
of imports of the subject merchandise, actual or potential, or the injury, is
negligible, or if the Government determines that it is in the public interest to
do so.

12. Clause 11 of the Bill seeks to amend section 12 of Act 504 to make public

interest an independent ground for determining whether to accept an undertaking.
Subsection 12(3) of Act 504 is amended to provide that no undertaking shall
