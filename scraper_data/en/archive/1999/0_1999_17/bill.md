EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Guardianship of Infants Act 1961 ("the Act").

1. _Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title to the Bill and its commencement._


-----

_Guardianship of Infants (Amendment)_

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act by introducing the definition_

of "Protector".

3. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 5 of the Act to accord to the mother of_

an infant the same rights in respect of that infant as the law presently accords
to his father.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to substitute section 6 of the Act. Besides being a consequential_

amendment necessitated by the amendment to section 5 of the Act, it also seeks
to empower the Court to appoint a guardian of an infant under certain circumstances.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to substitute section 7 of the Act so as to make it clear that_

the father or the mother of an infant has the power to appoint any person to
be guardian of that infant after his or her death and that the guardian is to act

jointly with the surviving parent. However, the proposed section 7 also provides

that if the surviving parent objects or if the guardian is of the opinion that the
surviving parent is unfit to have custody of the infant, that guardian may apply
to the Court and the Court may make an order with regard to the guardianship
of that infant.

6. _Clause 6 seeks to substitute section 8 of the Act for clarification purposes._

7. Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 8A into the Act to enable the
Court to appoint a Protector to be a temporary guardian of an infant's person
and property if the infant is an abandoned child or has no parent. It is proposed
that the Protector be appointed as such whether or not the infant has a foster
parent or is staying at a place of safety. The Court is required to determine the
extent of the powers and duties of a temporary guardian so appointed.

8. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 17 of the Act to increase the amount which_

can be applied for ah infant's maintenance or education by his guardian without
leave of the Court from three hundred ringgit to one thousand ringgit.

9. Clause 9 seeks to introduce new sections 19A and 19B into the Act. Under
the proposed section 19A, if two or more persons act as guardians of an infant
and there is dispute between them on any matter affecting the welfare of that
infant, any one of them can apply to the Court for direction.

The proposed section 19B seeks to enable the Court, if an order for the

maintenance of an infant has been made against any person and there is any
income or pension payable to that person, to order that part of that income or
pension be attached and paid to the person named by the Court.

10. Other amendments not specifically referred to are minor or consequential

in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
