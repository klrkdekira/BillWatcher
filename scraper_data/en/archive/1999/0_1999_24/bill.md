77(1A) provides that every company is required to furnish to the Director
General a return in the prescribed form for each year of assessment within six
months from the date the company closes its accounts. Where the accounts

to be furnished by the company together with the return for the year of assessment
in which the accounts are closed and the period to do so would be within six

the self-assessment system, the company is now required to show in the return
a computation of its tax payable. In addition, the company must also provide
in the return any information required of it. The new subsection 77(4) enables
the Director General to allow a return to be furnished electronically. This
amendment is effective from the year of assessment 2001.

from the second month of the basis period for which the estimate is furnished.
In the case of a new company, the payment shall be made by the tenth day

Subsection 107c(3) provides that the estimate of tax payable shall not be
less than the revised estimate or, if no revised estimate is furnished, the estimate
of tax payable for the immediately preceding year of assessment. Subsection
107c(7) allows a company to furnish a revised estimate in the sixth month of
