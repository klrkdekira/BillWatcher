guarantee in respect of which the consumer has

without significant cost to the consumer, in which case
the supplier shall collect the goods at its own expense;

**47. The damages that a consumer may recover for a failure of**

making it, the same rights against any or all of them
personally as the consumer would have had under this
Act if that person had supplied the goods to the consumer
as a result of the negotiations.

_Consumer Protection_ 45

(2) Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies to which

a supplier may be entitled, a supplier shall be entitled, where the

shall affect the exercise of any right or remedy given under this

as supplying any of the products so comprised therein.

**Meaning of "defect"**

**67. (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), there is a defect in**

is not such as a person is generally entitled to expect.

to another person.

(3) Nothing in this section shall require a defect to be inferred

from the mere fact that the safety of a product which is subsequently
supplied is greater than the safety of the product in question.


-----

### 56 Bill

(4) For the purposes of this section, "safety", in relation to a

product, shall include—

_(a) safety with respect to products comprised therein;_

_(b) safety in the context of risk of damage to property; and_

the product into Malaysia in order to supply it to another

the same damage, their liability shall be joint and several.

(7) This section shall be without prejudice to any liability arising

otherwise than under this Part.

that no proceeding shall be brought before the Tribunal or any
court in respect of any defect in any goods after the expiry of

brought in respect of such defect before the Tribunal or any court.

property shall be deemed to have occurred at the earliest time at
which a person with an interest in the property has knowledge
of the material facts about the loss or damage.


-----

### 58 Bill

(3) For the purposes of subsection (2)—

_(a) the material facts about any loss of or damage to any_

property are such facts about the loss or damage as would
lead a reasonable person with an interest in the property
to consider the loss or damage sufficiently serious to

justify his instituting proceedings for damages against

a defendant who does not dispute liability and is able
to satisfy a judgment against him;

_(b) a person's knowledge includes knowledge which he may_

reasonably be expected to acquire—

(i) from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or

(ii) from facts ascertainable by him with the help of

appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable
for him to seek:

Provided that a person shall not be deemed to have

knowledge of a fact ascertainable by him only with the

reasonable steps to obtain and where appropriate, to act
on that advice.

purposes of a claim under the Civil Law Act 1956, be made by
the personal representative or dependant, as the case may be, of
the deceased person.

(3) Where any damage is caused partly by a defect in a product

and partly by the fault of the person who suffered the damage,
the Civil Law Act 1956 shall have effect as if the defect were
the fault of every person liable under this Part for the damage
caused by the defect.


-----

_Consumer Protection_ 59

(4) For the purposes of any written law conferring jurisdiction

on any court with respect to any matter, liability for damage
under this Part shall be treated as liability in tort.

meaning as in the Civil Law Act 1956.

by any contract term, notice or other provision.

to another person;

_(c) that the defect did not exist in the product at the relevant_

time;

_(d) that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at_

the relevant time was not such that a producer of products
of the same description as the product in question may
reasonably be expected to discover the defect if it had
existed in his product while it was under his control; or

_(e) that the defect—_

(i) is a defect in a product in which the product in

question is comprised therein (the "subsequent
product"); and

(ii) is wholly attributable to—

_(A) the design of the subsequent product; or_
_(B) compliance by the producer of the product_

in question with instructions given by the
producer of the subsequent product.
