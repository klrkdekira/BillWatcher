## Bill

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1967("Act 53").

2. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 20 of Act 53. The proposed amendment_

is to provide that the basis year and the year of assessment shall be the same
calendar year. Prior to this amendment, the basis year is the calendar year
which precedes the year of assessment. This amendment is effective from 1
January 2000.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 21 of Act 53. The new subsection (2)_

specifically provides that where the accounts of a business have been made up
for a period of twelve months straddling over two calendar years, that period
of twelve months shall be taken as the basis period for a year of assessment
for that business. This amendment is effective from 1 January 2000.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 42 of Act 53. The amendment introduces_

subsection (2) to provide that where two basis periods overlap, the adjusted
income shall be apportioned on time basis so that the income will be distributed
evenly over the periods and the income attributed to that overlapping period
will not be taxed twice. This amendment is effective from the year of assessment

1999.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 77 of Act 53. Subsection (2) is amended_

to provide that in the event a person chargeable to tax has not been required
to furnish a return under subsection (1), that person is now under a duty to
notify the Director General of his chargeability before 15 April of the following
year. This amendment is effective from 1 January 2000.

6. _Clause 8 seeks to provide that tax on income arising in the basis period_

ending in the year 1999, other than those mentioned in that clause shall be
waived. This amendment is effective for the year of assessment 2000 on a
preceding year basis.

7. _Clause 9 is introduced to provide that the basis period for the year of_

assessment 2000 in respect of a person whose business ceased in 1998 is that
period which begins after its last basis period until the day of cessation. This

is so provided to enable that person and that business to still get the benefit
of the waiver. This amendment is effective for the year of assessment 2000 on
a preceding year basis.

8. _Clause 10 is introduced to provide that where the accounts of a business_

are made up for a period of more than twelve months, tax shall be waived on
the income attributed to the first twelve months and the remaining period shall
be taken to be a part of the basis period for the year of assessment 2000 on
a current year basis. This amendment is effective for the year of assessment
2000 on a preceding year basis.


-----

_Income Tax (Amendment)_ 13

9. Clause 11 is introduced to provide that for the purposes of the waiver,
allowances under Schedule 3 of. Act 53 shall be given as if a claim for such
allowances has been made. This amendment is effective for the year of assessment
2000 on a preceding year basis.

10. _Clause 12 provides that an amount equal to the chargeable income upon_

which tax is waived be credited to an exempt account. The provisions of
paragraphs 5 and 6 of Schedule 7 A to Act 53 regulating exempt accounts shall
apply to this provision. This amendment is effective for the year of assessment
2000 on a preceding year basis.

11. _Clauses 13 to 75 are the anti-avoidance provisions to avoid the taking of_

undue advantage of the waiver. This amendment is effective for the year of
assessment 2000 on a preceding year basis.

12. _Clause 16 provides for the computation of tax on income where the_

waiver does not apply by taking the difference between the tax on the chargeable
income and the tax on the chargeable income excluding the statutory income
on which tax is not waived. This amendment is effective for the year of assessment
2000 on a preceding year basis.

13. _Clause 17 explains that the year of assessment 2000 on a preceding year_

basis is followed by the year of assessment 2000 on a current year basis. This
means that there would be two years of assessment for the calendar year 2000.
This clause is effective from 1 January 2000.

14. The other amendments proposed in this Bill are minor or consequential

in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
