EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The proposed Tourism Vehicles Licensing Act 1999 ("the Act") seeks to provide
for the licensing and regulation of tourism vehicles. At present, the laws

governing the licensing and regulation of tourism vehicles are under the Commercial
Vehicles Licensing Board Act 1987 ("the 1987 Act"). The Government feels
that the licensing and regulation of tourism vehicles should come within the

jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Tourism. It is therefore expedient

that a separate Act be enacted for that purpose.

2. Generally, the provisions of the 1987 Act on tourism vehicles have been

retained. Nonetheless certain modifications have been made to cater to the
needs of the tourism industry.

3. Part I contains preliminary matters.

_Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions of the application and coming_

into operation of the proposed Act. Clause 2 defines certain words and expressions
used in the proposed Act. Clause 3 deals with the delegation of the powers and
functions of the Commissioner of Tourism.

4. Part II deals with the licensing of tourism vehicles.

_Clause 4 seeks to prohibit any person from carrying on or operating tourism_

vehicles business, that is the business of operating or letting out for hire excursion
buses or hire and drive cars for the conveyance of tourists, unless that person
is licensed under the proposed Act. Clause 5 deals with applications for licences
to carry on or operate tourism vehicles business, whilst clause 6 empowers the
Commissioner to grant or refuse to grant a licence. Clause 7 seeks to empower
the Commissioner to revoke any licence on the grounds set out in subclause
_7(1). Clause 8 provides that a licence is valid for a period not exceeding three_
years and clause 9 provides for the issue of a short term licence. Clause 10
lays down the conditions which the Commissioner may attach to any licence
and such conditions may be added, cancelled or varied by the Commissioner.
The statutory conditions applicable to every licence are found in clause 11.

_Clause 12 seeks to provide for the renewal of licences._

_5. Part III provides for appeals._

_Clause 15 provides a right of appeal to a person aggrieved by the refusal_

of the Commissioner to issue or renew any licence, any condition imposed by
the Commissioner or the revocation of any such licence. Clause 17 prohibits
a person whose appeal is still pending from making a similar application in
respect of the same class of vehicle. A licence granted as a result of such appeal
or subsequent application is void. Clause 18 provides for the surrender of the
licence upon the rejection of such appeal.

6. Part IV deals with offences and penalties.

_Clause 19 prohibits the use of unlicensed tourism vehicle whilst clause 20_

seeks to prohibit the use of a tourism vehicle if the licence in respect of the
vehicle has been suspended. Clause 21 requires the applicant for a licence or
for a variation of a licence or any of the conditions thereof to disclose other
transport interests he may have. The holder of a licence is required under clause
_22 to supply any information which may be required by the Commissioner._
_Clause 23 provides that no alteration can be made to the structure or fixed_
equipment of an authorized vehicle without the approval of the Director General
for Road Transport. Clause 24 prohibits the transfer or assigment of a licence
granted under the proposed Act. Clause 25 imposes a duty on the holder of
a licence to keep records and accounts, in respect of the licence and to furnish
the Commissioner with such records, accounts, financial and statistical returns
or other documents as may be required. Clause 26 specifies the offence relating
to false statements whilst clause 27 specifies the liability of the registered
owner of a tourism vehicle. Clause 30 provides that prosecution for an offence
under the proposed Act shall only be instituted by or with the written consent
of the Public Prosecutor. Clause 31 confers jurisdiction on a First Class Magistrate
to impose the maximum punishment as proposed under this Act notwithstanding
that subsection 87(1) of the Subordinate Courts Act 1948 ("Act 92") permits
a Magistrate to only pass a sentence not exceeding a fine of ten thousand ringgit
and imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

7. Part V contains miscellaneous matters such as seizure of tourism vehicles,

avoidance of contracts, the power of the Minister to make regulations and
transitional and savings provisions.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained. [PN(U[2])2077]
