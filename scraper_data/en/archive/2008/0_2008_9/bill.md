EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971
(“Act 30”).

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint
the commencement date of the proposed Act.


-----

_Universities and University Colleges (Amendment)_ 31

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 30 to introduce new definitions
and to amend existing definitions used in the Act.

The defintion of “Campus” is redrafted to include Branch Campus.

The definition of “Minister” is substituted for the purpose of clarification
to reflect the creation of two Ministries on education, namely Ministry of
Education and Ministry of Higher Education.

A new definition of “registrable offence” is essentially intended to replace
the words “criminal offence” used in Act 30.

The definition of “student” is amended to include students who are
following courses of instruction, practical training and research in, by or from
the University, whether part-time or full time and, whether by conventional
methods or through distance learning.

The substitution of the definition of “University or University College
education” seeks to expand the scope of the term to include research and
educational development and commercialization of such research and development
whether or not they lead to the award of a degree, diploma, or certificate.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to introduce new sections_ 4a and 4b into Act 30. Section
4a enables the Minister to appoint a committee to advise him on qualified
and suitable person for the appointment of Vice-Chancellor or any other post
to which he has the power to appoint under the Act. The appointment of such
committee is to promote transparency in the selection process for the said
posts. Section 4b empowers the Minister to second or transfer a University
employee to the service of any requesting University, statutory authority or
organization in Malaysia, subject to the consent of the said employee. If there
is any claim for compensation arising out of the said secondment or transfer,
the claim shall be met by the requesting party.

5. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 5 of Act 30 to ensure that no higher
educational institution with the status of a University is established except in
accordance with the provisions of Act 30 or the Private Higher Educational
Institutions Act 1996 (“Act 555”).

6. Clause 6 seeks to introduce a new subsection (1a) into section 6 of Act
30 with regard to the power of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to amend, vary or
revoke an Incorporation Order. Similar provision is also proposed in _clause_
_18 respecting an order establishing a University College._

7. _Clause 7 seeks to substitute section 12 of Act 30 to empower the Minister_
to establish a Campus of the University after consultation with the Board.
The power to make a Campus Order currently exercised by the Yang diPertuan Agong is proposed to be given to the Minister in view of the various
administrative arrangements the University is involved in due to the expansion
of students population. In the spirit of internationalization, this amendment
permits the establishment of campuses abroad. This _clause also allows the_
Vice-Chancellor to approve the use of any area for purposes of the University
on a temporary basis. The provisions of Act 30, the Constitution, Rules, _etc.,_
shall apply to that area as they apply to the Campus of the University in
order to facilitate the application of the University’s disciplinary and other
regulations, _etc. therein._


-----

32 _Bill_

8. _Clause 8 seeks to substitute section 15 of Act 30 to confer on students_
and student organizations freedom of association subject to restrictions in
relation to political parties, unlawful organizations and organizations, body
or group of persons identified by the Minister as unsuitable to the interest
and well-being of the students or the University. In addition to that, the ViceChancellor may, on the application of a student, exempt the student from the
restrictions mentioned in the proposed paragraph (1)(a). This will enable a
serving politician from any political party to enroll for a course at a University
without giving up his political career. The proposed amendment subsection (6)
seeks to expand the scope of freedom of speech and expression on academic
matters by a student. The proposed amendment to subsection (7) on the other
hand, seeks to remove the criminal penalties provided under this section and
to substitute them with disciplinary action. Decriminalization proposed in this
section is in line with the spirit of Act 30 which governs higher education.

9. _Clause 9_ seeks to amend section 15a of Act 30. The criminal penalty in
subsection (2) is substituted with disciplinary action and in order to provide
autonomy to the Universities, the power to grant exemption under subsection
15a(3) is now given to the Vice-Chancellor.

10. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section_ 15b of Act 30 to provide that if
a registrable offence has been committed in the name or on behalf of any
organization, body or group of students of a University, any student convicted
of such offence shall be liable to disciplinary action whilst the organization,
body or group of students liable to suspension or dissolution.

11. The substitution of criminal offence with disciplinary offence in the
proposed Act renders section 15c of Act 30 no longer necessary and hence
is deleted in _clause_ _11._

12. _Clause 12 seeks to replace section_ 15d of Act 30. The new section 15d
proposes reliefs to students facing criminal charges, detention, restriction
order or imprisonment. Subsection (1) seeks to confer discretion on the ViceChancellor to decide whether or not to suspend a student who is charged with
a registrable offence. Subsections (2) and (3) render a student who is convicted
of registrable offence, or detained or subjected to an order of restriction
under any written law relating to preventive detention or internal security,
liable to disciplinary action instead of him immediately ceases to be a student
under such circumstances by virtue of the existing provisions. Subsection
(4) seeks to allow a student who is placed under detention or subjected to
an order imposing restriction on him or who is being imprisoned, to sit for
his examination if consented to by the Senate and subject to an order being
made or approval given by the Minister responsible for internal security or
any competent authority, as the case may require. Subsections (5) and (6)
seek to respectively allow a student who is suspended from the University
or a student who ceases to be a student of the University under Act 30 to
pursue his studies at any other University with the written approval of the
Minister. These amendments are in line with the right to education for all.
Subsections (7) and (8) seek to provide that the period of suspension shall
not be considered in calculating the maximum duration permitted to complete
the course of study and in the computation of his result when a student is
discharged or acquitted of a registrable offence or released from detention or
restrictions imposed on him are revoked.


-----

_Universities and University Colleges (Amendment)_ 33

13. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 16 of Act 30 to give the organization,_
body or group of students of a University the right to make a written
representation before any suspension or dissolution is made against it by the
Vice-Chancellor. It also creates a right of appeal to the Minister.

14. _Clause 14 seeks to delete section_ 16a of Act 30 on discipline of staff,
officers and employees of University as the matter is now regulated by the
Statutory Bodies (Discipline & Surcharge) Act 2000 [Act 605].

15. _Clause 15 seeks to amend section 16b of Act 30 to improve the procedural_
safeguards for students in disciplinary proceedings.

16. _Clause 16 seeks to amend section 16c of Act 30 by removing the power_
of the Board to make rules for employee discipline as the matter is now
regulated by Act 605. With the amendment, section 16c is confined to rules
for student discipline.

17. _Clause 17 seeks to delete section_ 16d of Act 30 on surcharge as the
matter is now regulated by Act 605.

18. _Clause_ _22 seeks to amend section 24 of Act 30. The proposed amendment_
to subsection (1) seeks to ensure that no person is allowed to establish, manage
or maintain a higher educational institution with the status of “University” or
“University College” unless it is a higher educational institution established in
accordance with Act 30 or Act 555. The amendment to subsection(2) seeks to
ensure that no higher educational institution or person shall issue to or confer
on any person any degree or diploma purporting to be degree or diploma
issued or conferred by a University or University College unless the issue or
conferment is in accordance with the provisions of Act 30 or Act 555.

19. _Clause_ _25 seeks to amend section 26 of Act 30 to empower the Yang_
di-Pertuan Agong to exempt any University or University College from any
provisions of Act 30 or the First and Second Schedules, or to vary the Schedules
in their applications to any University or University College.

20. _Clause 26 seeks to amend the Constitution of the University in the First_
Schedule to Act 30.

_Paragraph (a) seeks to amend certain existing definitions and introduce_
certain new definitions.

_Paragraph (b)_ seeks to amend, amongst others, paragraphs 4(1)(m) and
_(n) of the Constitution to empower the Board to consider appeals from any_
person aggrieved by the decisions on appointments and promotion and to
allow secondment of employee of the University respectively. To remove
any ambiguity, the new subsection (3) is introduced to state categorically the
powers to be exercised by the Board and by the Senate.

_Paragraph (c) seeks to amend section 9 of the Constitution. The amendment_
to subsection (1) provides the procedure for the appointment of the ViceChancellor. A new subsection (1a) is introduced to specifically provide that
the Vice-Chancellor is accountable to the Board. The amendment to subsection
(3) reflects the role of the Vice-Chancellor as chief executive officer and
subsection (4) is deleted as the powers of the Vice-Chancellor spelt out therein
are now transferred to the Board.
