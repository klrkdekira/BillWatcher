(2) For the purpose of computing a Judge's pension and
gratuity, where any pension or gratuity has been paid to the

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Judges' Remuneration Act 1971 ("Act 45") for
the primary purpose of enabling the period of service of a full-time Judicial
Commissioner who is appointed to be a Judge of a High Court to be taken
into account for the purpose of computing the pension and gratuity payable
to him upon his retirement as a Judge.

2. Judicial Commissioners are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong under
Article 122AB of the Federal Constitution for the despatch of business of the
High Court in Malaya and the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak. When they
are appointed to serve as Judicial Commissioners full time, they perform the
same functions, have the same powers and enjoy the same immunities as a
Judge of a High Court. However, if a Judicial Commissioner is appointed to
be a Judge, his period of service as Judicial Commissioner is disregarded in
the computation of the pension and gratuity payable to him upon his retirement
as a Judge.

3. In view of the fact that the functions performed by a full-time Judicial
Commissioner are the same as those performed by a Judge, it is only proper
that, if the Judicial Commissioner is subsequently appointed to be a Judge, his

period of service as a Judicial Commissioner be recognised in the computation
of his pension and gratuity as a Judge. Therefore, it is proposed in clause 3
of the Bill that a new section 7A which grants that recognition be introduced
into Act 45.

For Judicial Commissioners who served in that capacity on secondment from
the public service and had been paid pension and gratuity as public officers
for the period of such service, the proposed new section 7A also provides that
the total sum of pension and gratuity payable at the end of their period of
service as a Judge shall be reduced by the amount of the pension and gratuity
so paid. This is to avoid double payment of pension and gratuity to them for
the same period of service.

It is also proposed that the new section 7A shall apply only to the period
of service as a Judicial Commissioner of a Judge who is still in service on
the date of coming into operation of the proposed amendment Act.

4. The amendment of section 1A of Act 45 as proposed in clause 2 of the Bill
involves the insertion of the definition of the term "Judicial Commissioner",
to facilitate the interpretation of that term in view of the use of that term in
the proposed new section 7A.

5. The amendment of section 19A of Act 45 as proposed in clause 4 is
consequential to the amendment proposed in clause 2.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
