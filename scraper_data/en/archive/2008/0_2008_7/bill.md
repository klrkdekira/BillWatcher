(3) A person making a statement under this section shall be legally bound

to state the truth, whether or not such statement is made wholly or partly in

answer to questions.

(4) The authorized officer examining a person under subsection (1) shall

first inform that person of the provisions of subsections (2) and (3).

(5) A statement made by any person under this section shall, wherever

possible, be reduced into writing and signed by the person making it or affixed

with his thumb print, as the case may be, after ―

_(a)_ it has been read to him in the language in which he made it; and


-----

_(b)_ he has been given an opportunity to make any correction he may

wish.

**Admissibility of statements in evidence**

**68. (1) In any trial or inquiry by a court into an offence under this Act, any**

statement, whether the statement amounts to a confession or not, is oral or in

writing, made at any time, whether before or after the person is charged and

whether in the course of an investigation under this Act or not and whether or not

wholly or partly in answer to questions, by an accused person to or in the hearing

of an authorized officer and whether or not interpreted to him by any other

authorized officer or any other person, whether concerned or not in the arrest of

that person, shall, notwithstanding any written law or rule of law to the contrary,

be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a

witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the

purpose of impeaching his credit.

(2)  No statement made under subsection (1) shall be admissible or used

as provided for in that subsection if the making of the statement appears to the

court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having

reference to the charge against the person proceeding from a person in authority

and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give that person grounds which would

appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any

advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings

against him.

(3)  Where any person is arrested or is informed that he may be

prosecuted for any offence under this Act, he shall be served by the authorized

officer with a notice in writing, which shall be explained to him, to the following

effect:

“You have been arrested/informed that you may be prosecuted for

…………….. (the possible offence under this Act). Do you wish to say


-----

anything? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your

defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back

till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and

this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to

mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be

done.”.

(4)  Notwithstanding subsection (3), a statement by any person accused of

any offence under this Act made before there is time to serve a notice under that

subsection shall not be rendered inadmissible in evidence merely by reason of

no such notice having been served on him if such notice has been served on him

as soon as is reasonably possible thereafter.

(5) No statement made by an accused person in answer to a written notice

served on him pursuant to subsection (3) shall be construed as a statement

caused by any inducement, threat or promise as is described in subsection (2), if

it is otherwise voluntary.

(6) Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an offence

under this Act, evidence is given that the accused, on being informed that he

might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any such fact, being a fact which in

the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected

to mention when so informed, the court, in determining whether the prosecution

has made out a prima facie case against the accused and in determining whether

the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inference from the

failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences,

be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence given

against the accused in relation to which the failure is material.

(7) Nothing in subsection (6) shall in any criminal proceedings ―

_(a)_ prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or other

reaction of the accused in the face of anything said in his


-----

presence relating to the conduct in respect of which he is

charged, in so far as evidence of it would be admissible apart

from that subsection; or

_(b)_ be taken to preclude the drawing of any inference from any such

silence or other reaction of the accused which could be drawn

apart from that subsection.

**Sale and disposal of seized kenaf or tobacco, etc.**

**69.** (1) The Director General may at any time direct that any kenaf, kenaf

product, tobacco or tobacco product seized under this Act be sold and the

proceeds of the sale be held while waiting for the result of any prosecution under

this Act where—

_(a)_ the kenaf, kenaf product, tobacco or tobacco product is of a

perishable nature or easily deteriorates in quality;

_(b)_ the custody of the kenaf, kenaf product, tobacco or tobacco

product involves unreasonable expense and inconvenience; or

_(c)_ there is a lack or absence of adequate or proper facilities for the

storage of the kenaf, kenaf product, tobacco or tobacco

product.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), where an analyst certifies, or if the

results of tests as certified by an analyst proves, that the kenaf, kenaf product,

tobacco or tobacco product tested by him is contaminated or is of a quality,

standard or grade lower than that prescribed or permitted by any regulation, the

seizing officer may keep it in custody, or if no prosecution is instituted in respect

of the kenaf, kenaf product, tobacco or tobacco product, cause it to be disposed

of in accordance with subsection 70(3).
