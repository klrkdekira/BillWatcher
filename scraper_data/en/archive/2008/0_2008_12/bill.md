the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any
inducement, threat ot promise having reference to the charge

which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by
making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a
temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

be prosecuted for any offence under this Act, he shall be served

now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence
may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad
effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any
fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be
done.”.

(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), a statement by any person
accused of any offence under this Act made before there is time
to serve a notice under that subsection shall not be rendered
inadmissible in evidence merely by reason of no such notice
having been served on him if such notice has been served on
him as soon as is reasonably possible thereafter.


-----

54 _Bill_

(5) No statement made by an accused person in answer to
a written notice served on him pursuant to subsection (3) shall

or promise as is described in subsection (2), if it is otherwise
voluntary.

(6) Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for
an offence under this Act, evidence is given that the accused,
on being informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to
mention any such fact, being a fact which in the circumstances
existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to
mention when so informed, the court, in determining whether the
prosecution has made out a _prima facie_ case against the accused
and in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence
charged, may draw such inferences from the failure as appear
proper; and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences, be
treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration of any
evidence given against the accused in relation to which the failure
is material.

(7) Nothing in subsection (6) shall in any criminal
proceedings—

_(a)_ prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or
other reaction of the accused in the face of anything
said in his presence relating to the conduct in respect
of which he is charged, in so far as evidence thereof
would be admissible apart from that subsection; or

_(b)_ be taken to preclude the drawing of any inference from
any such silence or other reaction of the accused which
could be drawn apart from that subsection.

**are dead or cannot be traced,** **_etc._**

before any court, where the person who made the statement or
the document or the copy of the document is dead, or cannot be
traced or found, or has become incapable of giving evidence, or
whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay
or expense which appears to the court unreasonable.

**Certificate of position or office held**

**55. (1) A certificate issued by a principal or an officer on behalf**
of his principal shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings
against any person for any offence under this Act as _prima facie_
proof that the person named in such certificate—

_(a)_ held the position, office or capacity as specified in such
certificate and for such period as so specified; and

_(b)_ received the emoluments as specified in such
certificate.

(2) A certificate issued under subsection (1) shall be _prima_
_facie proof that it was issued by the person purporting to issue_
it as principal or on behalf of the principal without proof of the
signature of the person who issued such certificate and without
proof of the authority of such person to issue it.

**Admissibility of translation of documents**

**56. (1) Where any document which is to be used in any**
proceedings against any person for an offence under this Act is
in a language other than the national language or the English
language, a translation of such document into the national language
or the English language shall be admissible where the translation
is accompanied by a certificate of the person who translated the

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to provide for the establishment of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption
Commission and to make new and better provisions for the prevention of
corruption. This Bill repeals the Anti-Corruption Act 1997 [Act 575]. Most
of the provisions of Act 575 are retained, but with drafting amendments and
modifications made to them. New features are the proposed establishment of
the Anti-Corruption Advisory Board and the Special Committee on Corruption.
Provisions relating to powers of investigation and certain definitions have been
amended to provide for more effective implementation of the Act proposed
by this Bill.

2. Part I of the Bill deals with preliminary matters.

_Clause 1_ provides for the short title and commencement of the proposed
Act.

_Clause 2 seeks to state the objects of the proposed Act._

_Clause 3 contains the definitions of the words and expressions used in this_
Bill. The definitions which differ from what had been provided in Act 575
include “prescribed offence”, “public body” and “relative’.

3. Part II contains provisions relating to the establishment of the Malaysian
Anti-Corruption Commission (“the Commission”) and its officers.

_Clause 4 provides for the establishment of the Commission._

_Clause 5_ provides for the appointment of the Chief Commissioner while
_clause 6 provides for the appointment of officers and junior officers of the_
Commission.

_Clause 7 seeks to provide for the functions of the officers of the Commission,_
which are no different from those in section 8 of Act 575.

_Clauses 8_ and 9 provide for matters which need to be observed by such
officers generally when carrying out their functions under the proposed Act.

Powers and duties of officers of the Commission are spelt out in _clauses_
_10 and_ _11 respectively._

4. Part III contains provisions on the establishment of the Anti-Corruption
Advisory Board, the Special Committee on Corruption and the Complaints
Committee.


-----

64 _Bill_

_Clause 13_ seeks to establish the Anti-Corruption Advisory Board whose
members will be appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of
the Prime Minister.

_Clause 14 seeks to provide for the establishment of the Special Committee_
on Corruption whose members shall be members of Parliament appointed by
the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The members of Parliament to be appointed shall
be nominated by the Leader of the House of Representatives.

_Clause 15 seeks to establish a Complaints Committee to monitor the handling_
of non-criminal complaints.

5. Part IV contains the main offences and penalties in relation to corruption.
Such offences are basically the offences now provided for in Part II of
Act 575. _Clauses 16, 17, 19, 20,_ and _21 of the Bill correspond to section 10,_
paragraphs 11(a) and _(b), sections 12, 13 and 14 of Act 575._ _Clause 18_ is
similar to paragraph 11(c) of Act 575.

_Clause 22 is a new provision which seeks to provide for the offence of_
bribery of foreign public official to enable Malaysia to comply with the United
Nations Convention Against Corruption.

Part IV also seeks to require a person to whom gratification is offered
or any person from whom gratification is requested to report such offer or
request. This is contained in _clause 25._

Under clause 26, a person commits an offence if he deals with, uses, holds,
receives or conceals any property which is the subject-matter of any of the
offences proposed in _clauses 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22 or 23._

_Clause 27 seeks to make it an offence for any person to make any statement_
which is false or which is intended to mislead to an officer of the Commission
or the Public Prosecutor who is exercising powers under the proposed Act.

_Clause 28 seeks to make every attempt, preparation, abetment and criminal_
conspiracy to commit an offence under the proposed Act punishable with the
same penalty as provided for such offence.

6. Part V contains provisions on investigation, search, seizure and arrest. This
Part covers provisions which now are in Parts IV and V of Act 575. Since
certain powers in relation to investigation in the existing Part V of Act 575
are now proposed to be given to officers of the Commission authorized by
the Public Prosecutor and will no longer be within the sole purview of the
Public Prosecutor, there is no longer a need to maintain a part on powers of
the Public Prosecutor.

_Clause 29 seeks to give an officer of the Commission the power to investigate_
reports and to enquire into information.

_Clause 30 seeks to allow an officer of the Commission to examine persons_
and to require persons being examined to produce books, documents, records,

of or in connection with an offence under the proposed Act, to require that
person to furnish a sworn statement in writing identifying all property owned
by him or in his possession and to give other information in respect of such
property. An officer of the Commission of the rank of Commissioner and
above is also to be given the power to require any relative or associate of
such person to give similar information. Failure to furnish such information
will be an offence.

Further under clause 36, if such officer has reason to believe that a person
who has been required to furnish information about property he owns or in his
possession owns or possesses property which is in excess of his emoluments,
he may require such person to give satisfactory explanation about the excess.
Failure to give such explanation will be an offence.

_Clauses 37 and_ _38 seek to empower the Public Prosecutor to order banks_
not to part with or deal in movable property in banks and to order seizure of
immovable property in the manner set out in those clauses if such property
is the subject-matter of an offence or is evidence of an offence under the
proposed Act.

order prohibiting any person from dealing with any property held or deposited
outside Malaysia if such property is the subject-matter of an offence or is
used in the commission of an offence under the proposed Act.

recording of the intercepted conversation.

Commission of the rank of Commissioner or above authorized by the Public

offence under the proposed Act to surrender his travel documents.

and the rights of such person.

7. Part VI contains provisions on evidence.

given, promised or offered any gratification, he is presumed to have done so
as a reward or an inducement for all the matters set out in the particulars of
the charge, unless the contrary is proved. Similar presumptions also apply in
the case of an offence under sections 161, 162, 163, 164 and 165 of the Penal
Code and paragraph 137(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1967.

Under _clause 51, the inability of any person to give a satisfactory account_
