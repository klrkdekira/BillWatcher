10 _Bill_

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to amend section 106b of Act 235 to specify that for the
purposes of Act 235, a senior officer of customs shall have all the powers of

such powers shall be in addition to the powers provided for under Act 235
and not in derogation thereof.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to introduce a new section 119a into Act 235 to require

283 of the Criminal Procedure Code. For the purpose of the proposed new
section 119a, the court has civil jurisdiction to the extent of the amount of
the customs duty due and payable, and the order is enforceable in all respects
as a final judgment of the court in favour of the Director General. When any
person has been found not guilty of an offence under Act 235 and he has
paid the customs duty due and payable or penalty payable pursuant to the
proposed section 145a, the court may order the amount paid to be refunded
where no notice of appeal is filed.

_Subclause 6(a) seeks to amend paragraph 133(1)(c) of Act 235 to make it_

to customs to be counterfeited or falsified or to cause to be used or to assist
in the use of counterfeited or falsified document.

_Subclause 6(c)_ seeks to amend subsection 133(1) of Act 235 to increase

a term not exceeding seven years or both.

_Subclause 8(e) seeks to introduce new subparagraphs 135(1)(iv) and (v)_

into Act 235. The proposed subparagraph 135(1)(iv) seeks to provide a
specific penalty for the offence under subsection 135(1) of Act 235 relating
to cigarettes containing tobacco or intoxicating liquor included in a class of
goods appearing in an order made under subsection 11(1) of Act 235. The
proposed subparagraph 135(1)(v) seeks to provide a specific penalty for the
offence under subsection 135(1) of Act 235 relating to cigarettes containing

made to deter the smuggling of cigarettes containing tobacco and intoxicating
liquor which is currently increasing, and to prevent the loss of revenue to the
Government.

_Subclause 9(a)_ seeks to amend paragraph 136(a) of Act 235 to provide

years or a fine not exceeding five hundred thousand ringgit or both. For the
second or subsequent conviction, the penalty is increased from imprisonment
for a term not exceeding five years or a fine not exceeding twenty thousand
ringgit or both to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or a
fine not exceeding one million ringgit or both.


-----

12 _Bill_

11. _Clause 10_ seeks to amend subsection 137(1) of Act 235 to increase the

fine for the offences under paragraphs 137(1)(a), _(b) and_ _(c) of Act 235 from_
a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit to a fine not exceeding five hundred
thousand ringgit.

12. _Clause 11 seeks to amend section 138 of Act 235 to increase the general_

penalty for the offences against Act 235 in respect of which no penalty is
expressly provided from a fine not exceeding twenty thousand ringgit to a
fine not exceeding fifty thousand ringgit.

13. _Clause 12_ seeks to introduce a new paragraph 142(19a) into Act 235 to

empower the Minister to regulate any matter relating to customs agent.

14. _Clause 13_ seeks to amend section 143 of Act 235 to allow any person

aggrieved by any decision of the Director General to apply to the Director
General to review any of his decision within thirty days from the date the person
has been notified of such decision provided that no appeal has been made on
the same decision to the Tribunal or High Court. The proposed section 143
disallows review to be made in any matter relating to compound or subsection
128(3) of Act 235. This provision also allows any person aggrieved by any
decision of the Director General on the review or under any other provision
of Act 235, except any matter relating to compound or subsection 128(3)
of Act 235, to appeal to the Tribunal within thirty days from the date of
notification in writing of the decision to the aggrieved person. This provision
also clarifies that any customs duty payable under Act 235 shall be paid on
the due date notwithstanding that any review or appeal has been made under
the proposed section.

15. _Clause 14_ seeks to introduce a new section 145a into Act 235. The

proposed section 145a provides that the institution of proceedings or the
imposition of a penalty, fine or term of imprisonment under Act 235, or the
compounding of an offence under section 131 of Act 235, shall not relieve
any person from the liability to pay for customs duty, penalty or surcharge
under Act 235.

16. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor

or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
