EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Civil Law Act 1956 (“Act 67”) to extend the
categories of persons who can claim damages for loss of dependency, to extend
the age limit for the purposes of assessing the loss of earnings in claims for
damages for loss of dependency and for personal injury, to amend the provisions
for determining the multiplier in assessing the loss of earnings and the loss
of future earnings, to increase the amount of damages for bereavement and to
extend the categories of persons entitled to claim for damages for bereavement.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the provision on the commencement_
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 2 of Act 67 to introduce the definition
of “persons with disabilities” into Act 67.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 7 of Act 67.

_Subclause 3(a)_ seeks to substitute the shoulder note to section 7 of Act 67

to state the persons entitled to claim damages for loss of dependency.

_Subclause 3(b)_ seeks to amend subsection 7(2) of Act 67 to extend the

categories of persons who can claim damages for loss of dependency to
persons with disabilities under the care of a person whose death was caused

_Civil Law (Amendment)_ 5

by wrongful act, neglect or default. With the proposed amendment, any
persons with disabilities within the meaning of the Persons with Disabilities
Act 2008 [Act 685] who is under the care of the deceased person may
now claim damages for loss of dependency. The present provision of
subsection 7(2) of Act 67 only allows the wife, husband, parent and child of
the deceased person to claim damages for loss of dependency.

_Subparagraph 3(c)(i)(A) seeks to amend subparagraph (iv)(a) of the proviso_

to subsection 7(3) of Act 67 to extend the age limit for the purposes of
assessing the loss of earnings in claims for damages for loss of dependency.
Prior to the amendment, loss of earnings shall not be taken into consideration
if the deceased person has attained the age of fifty-five years at the time of
death. However, since the retirement age for public service officers has been
extended to the age of sixty years in accordance with the Pensions (Amendment)
Act 2011 [Act A1409] and the minimum retirement age for employees under
a contract of service with an employer has been set at the age of sixty years
in accordance with the Minimum Retirement Age Act 2012 [Act 753], the
proposed amendment to the provision is in line with the two laws as a person
could now be working until the age of sixty years.

_Subparagraph 3(c)(i)(B) seeks to amend subparagraph (iv)(a) of the proviso_

to subsection 7(3) of Act 67 to delete the requirement of good health prior
to the deceased’s death. This is because with technological advancement in
medicine and medical treatment a person could still work productively even
though that person does not enjoy good health. With this proposed amendment,
health factor will only be made a basis for reducing an award for loss of
earnings.

_Paragraph 3(c)(ii)_ seeks to amend subparagraph (iv)(d) of the proviso

to subsection 7(3) of Act 67 in respect of computation of the multiplier for
assessment of loss of earnings.

_Subclause 3(d)_ seeks to amend subsection 7(3a) of Act 67 to increase the

amount of damages for bereavement from the present ten thousand ringgit to
thirty thousand ringgit.

_Subclause 3(e)_ seeks to amend subsection 7(3b) of Act 67 to include the

child of the deceased person in the categories of persons who is entitled to
claim for damages for bereavement. Prior to the amendment, only the spouse
of the deceased and parents of the deceased who was a minor and was never
married may make a claim for bereavement under subsection 7(3a) of Act 67.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 11 of Act 67 as a consequential amendment_
to the introduction of the new section 6a into the Limitation Act 1953 [Act 254].
The new section 6a of Act 254 allows a person to take action on negligence
involving latent damage in construction cases which was discovered outside
the limitation period of six years from the date the cause of action accrued.
Because there is an extended limitation period under the new section, thus
this proposed amendment seeks to provide that any interest given by the Court
for recovery of damages under the new section 6a of Act 254 shall be for the
whole or any part of the period between the discovery of the damage and the
date of judgment, and not from the date the cause of action accrued.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend section 28a of Act 67.

6 _Bill_

_Paragraph 5(a)(i)_ seeks to amend subparagraph 28a(2)(c)(i) of Act 67 to

extend the age limit for the purposes of assessing the loss of future earnings
in claims for damages for personal injury not resulting in death. Prior to the
amendment, loss of future earnings shall not be taken into account if the
plaintiff has attained the age of fifty-five years at the time of injury. However,
since the retirement age for public service officers has been extended to the
age of sixty years in accordance with the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2011

[Act A1409] and the minimum retirement age for employees under a contract of
service with an employer has been set at the age of sixty years in accordance
with the Minimum Retirement Age Act 2012 [Act 753], the proposed amendment
to the provision is in line with the two laws as a person could now be working
until the age of sixty years.

_Paragraph 5(a)(ii)_ seeks to amend subparagraph 28a(2)(c)(i) of Act 67 to

delete the requirement of good health prior to the plaintiff’s injury. This is
because with technological advancement in medicine and medical treatment a
person could still work productively even though that person does not enjoy
good health. With this proposed amendment, health factor will only be made
a basis for reducing an award for loss of future earnings.

_Subclause 5(b)_ seeks to amend subparagraph 28a(2)(d)(ii) of Act 67 in

respect of computation of the multiplier for assessment of loss of future
earnings.

7. _Clause 6_ deals with savings provision.

8. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
