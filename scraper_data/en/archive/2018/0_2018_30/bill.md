any other provisions of Act 176, except any matter relating to compound or
subsection 67(3) of Act 176, to appeal to the Tribunal within thirty days from

duty or penalty shall be recoverable in the same manner as provided under
section 283 of the Criminal Procedure Code. For the purposes of the proposed
new section 59a, the court has civil jurisdiction to the extent of the amount
of the excise duty due and payable and the order is enforceable in all respects
as a final judgment of the court in favour of the Director General. When any
person has been found not guilty of an offence under Act 176 and he has paid

section 82a, the court may order the amount paid to be refunded where no
notice of appeal is filed.
