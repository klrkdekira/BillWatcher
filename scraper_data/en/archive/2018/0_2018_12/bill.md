EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Free Zones Act 1990 [Act 438] in respect of the
reference to the Sales Tax Act 1972 [Act 64] and the Service Tax Act 1975

[Act 151]. This amendment is consequential to the implementation of a new
tax system namely sales tax and service tax as proposed under the Sales Tax
Bill 2018 and the Service Tax Bill 2018 which will replace the goods and
services tax under the Goods and Services Tax Act 2014 [Act 762].

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title of the proposed Act and empowers the
Minister to appoint the date of commencement of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 2 of Act 438 by deleting the definitions
of “sales tax”, “service” and “service tax” in consequence of the proposed
amendments in _clauses 3_ to 9.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 438 to remove matters relating_
to services, sales tax and service tax in the free zones as these matters have
been provided for under the proposed Sales Tax Bill 2018 and Service Tax
Bill 2018.


-----

4 _Bill_

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 438._

_Subclause 4(b)_ seeks to amend subsection 6(1) of Act 438 to remove

the power of the Minister to exclude any services from the provision of
section 4 of Act 438 as this power has been provided for under the proposed
Service Tax Bill 2018.

_Subclause 4(c)_ seeks to amend subsection 6(2) of Act 438 to remove the

application of the Sales Tax Act 1972 and Service Tax Act 1975 to goods and
services excluded from the provision of section 4 of Act 438 as these matters
have been provided for under the proposed Sales Tax Bill 2018 and Service
Tax Bill 2018.

6. _Clauses 5_ to 9 seek to amend sections 21, 22, 23, 26 and 28 of
Act 438, respectively by deleting the references to the “Sales Tax Act 1972”
and the “Service Tax Act 1975”. Currently, sections 21, 22, 23, 26 and 28 of
Act 438 provide for the enforcement powers in relation to sales tax and
service tax in the free zones under the Sales Tax Act 1972 and the Service
Tax Act 1975 which Acts have been repealed by the Goods and Services Tax
Act 2014. With the proposed Sales Tax Bill 2018 and Service Tax Bill 2018,
the enforcement powers relating to sales tax and service tax in the free zones
have been provided for under those proposed Bills, respectively. To avoid the
overlap of enforcement powers in the free zones, the references to the “Sales
Tax Act 1972” and the “Service Tax Act 1975” are deleted.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN(U2)3121]
