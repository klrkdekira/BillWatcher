EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to repeal the Anti-Fake News Act 2018 (“Act 803”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act._

3. _Clause 2 seeks to provide for the repeal of Act 803 due to the change in_
the policy of the Government that fake news may be dealt with under existing
laws such as the Penal Code [Act 574], the Printing Presses and Publications
Act 1984 [Act 301] and the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998

[Act 588]. As such, Act 803 is no longer relevant. This clause also contains
savings provisions.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.

[PN(U2)3123]
