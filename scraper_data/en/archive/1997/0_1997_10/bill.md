## 6 Bill

by virtue of the proposed subsection 3(5), include any permanent
resident of Malaysia.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend subsection 4(4) of the Act to increase
the quorum for a meeting of the Board from five to nine members
consequent upon the increase proposed in clause 2.

_4. Clause 4 seeks to amend subsection 13(7) of the Act to enable_
the various disciplinary punishments provided for in section 18 A to
be imposed on a body corporate. At present the only punishment
provided for is the removal of its name from the register.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend paragraph 14(3)(b) of the Act to enable_
the various disciplinary punishments provided for in section 18 A to
be imposed on any executor, administrator or trustee of the deceased
registered pharmacist or any person in the employment of the executor,
administrator or trustee.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend subsection 17(1) of the Act to enable
a distinction to be made between the removal of a person's name
from the register as a form of disciplinary action and the removal
of a person's name from the register due to his death, having
permanently left Malaysia or unsoundness of mind or infirmity which
renders him incapable of practising as a pharmacist.

7. Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 18A. The new section
18 A enables the Board at the conclusion of an inquiry to impose
disciplinary punishment in the exercise of its diciplinary jurisdiction.
The Board may at the conclusion of the inquiry order the person
or body corporate whose misconduct is the subject of the inquiry,
to pay costs to the Board or to the complainant where disciplinary
punishment is imposed. The Board may also order the complainant
to pay costs to the registered pharmacist or body corporate where
no case has been made out against the registered pharmacist or
body corporate. Such costs may be recovered as a civil debt.

8. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 19 of the Act to allow those
upon whom a punishment of removal, suspension or reprimand has
been imposed, to appeal against such order. This amendment is
consequential to the introduction of the proposed section 18A.

9. Clause 9 seeks to amend subsection 22(1) of the Act by adding
a new paragraph (ba). The new paragraph (ba) enables regulations
to be made for the establishment of a Committee of Inquiry to
inquire into any complaint or information which the Board is
empowered to inquire into.
