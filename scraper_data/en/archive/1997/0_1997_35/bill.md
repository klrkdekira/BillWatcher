EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Societies Act 1966 ("the Act").

2. ,Clause 2 seeks to amend section 3 of the Act. With the
amendment, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong now appoints the Registrar
of Societies and the Deputy Registrars whereas the Assistant Registrars
and other officers are appointed by the Minister. The new subsection
OB) seeks to make it clear that the Deputy Registrars, Assistant
Registrars and other officers appointed under section 3 are all subject
to the direction and control of the Registrar.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to introduce a new section 3B into the Act to_
empower the Registrar to delegate any of his powers to any Assistant
Registrar. He may also impose restrictions and limitations in the
instrument of delegation. This power of delegation is to be exercised
by the Registrar personally.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 6 of the Act by increasing the_
maximum fine which can be imposed on a local society that organises
or takes part in any activity without the written permission of the
Registrar. The maximum fine is increased from two thousand ringgit
to five thousand ringgit. The fine in respect of a continuing offence
has also been increased. Apart from this clause, clauses 6, 7(b), 9,
_11, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23(b), 24, 25, 26, 28 and 33 also seek_
to increase the penalties in sections 9A, 11, 13A, 15, 42, 44, 45, 46,
47, 48, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54 and 66 respectively of the Act.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 7 of the Act to enable the_
Registrar to impose certain conditions on the local society making
an application for registration under the Act.

6. _Clause 8 (d) seeks to amend section 13 of the Act to add three_
new criteria for the cancellation of the registration of a society.
_Clauses 8(e) and 8 (f) seek to require the Registrar, when he proposes_
to cancel the registration of a society under paragraph 13(l)(c), to
inform the office-bearers of his intention and give them an opportunity
to submit reasons in writing within 30 days from the date of notification
why the registration should not be cancelled. Pending his decision
on whether or not to cancel the registration of the society he may
by order in writing suspend the activities of the society. The order
to suspend the activities of the society shall continue in force until
the order is revoked or the registration of the society is cancelled.

7. Clause 10 seeks to amend section 14 of the Act to make it clear
that where no annual general meeting of a society has been held,
the society shall forward the documents and information required


-----

_Societies (Amendment)_ 11

year. At the moment, no period is specified. This clause also seeks
to amend the period for the submission of information by a society
which holds its annual general meeting from 28 days to 60 days
after that meeting. Clause 10(b) requires the registered society to
furnish information to the Registrar with regard to the name and
address of any society outside Malaysia to which the registered
society is in any way associated or affiliated.

8. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 16 of the Act to make it clear_
that where a notice under subsection (1) has not been complied
with by a society, the Registrar need not immediately cancel the
registration of the society but may take the necessary steps to cancel
the registration of the society under section 13.

9. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 21 of the Act. Paragraph_
21(l)(c) of the Act as amended provides that a mutual benefit society
will not be entitled to registration if its rules provide for the admission
of members or subscribers not resident within the limits of a town
in Malaysia in which the society proposes to carry on its business.
However, the new proviso provides that where a mutual benefit
society is established in a particular place of work for the benefit
of its members or subscribers, then, notwithstanding that the members
or subscribers reside outside the limits of the town, the mutual
benefit society will still be entitled to registration.

10. _Clauses 15 and 16 seek to delete subsection 32(1) and sections_
33 and 34 of the Act in order to remove the necessity for a special
resolution before a change of name of a society can be effected.

11. _Clause 23 seeks to amend section 49 of the Act by introducing_
a new subsection (2) which provides that where the registration of
a society has been cancelled under section 2A or paragraph 13(1)
_(b) of the Act the restriction imposed on an office-bearer under_
subsection (1) shall cease upon the expiry of five years beginning
from the date of cancellation.

12. _Clause 27 seeks to introduce a new section 53A into the Act_
to make it an offence for any person to display or use any certificate
of registration of a society or a copy of such certificate when the
registration of the society has been cancelled.

13. _Clause 29 seeks to introduce a new section 54A into the Act_
to make it an offence for any one to furnish false information or
documents to the Registrar.

14. _Clause 30 seeks to amend section 60 of the Act to include_
offences against the provisions of sections 9A and 13A as offences
which are deemed to be seizable, non-bailable and registrable.


-----

12 _Bill_

15. Section 61 of the Act provides that except in the case of
persons charged under certain provisions of the Act, prosecution
shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Public
Prosecutor. Clause 31 seeks to include the case of persons charged
under section 13A as one of the cases falling within the exception
to subsection 61(1).

16. _Clause 32 seeks to amend section 64 of the Act by introducing_
a new subsection (2) to enable the Registrar, or an Assistant Registrar,
or any other officer, entering any place under subsection (1) to
seize and detain any books, accounts or other articles belonging to '
a society which he has reason to believe may be required in respect
of proceedings under the Act.

17. Clause 34 seeks to amend paragraph 1 _(a) of the First Schedule_
to the Act to provide that the registered place of business of a
society is one of the particulars for which provision shall be made
in the constitution or rules of every local society or branch thereof.

18. Other proposed amendments to the Act which have not been
specifically referred to are consequential or minor in nature.
