EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Securities Industry Act 1983 (the

"Act").

2. _Clause I seeks to provide for the short title and commencement_

of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend the long title of the Act by deleting_

the word "stock brokers" as the term is now a defunct term.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act by amending the_

definition of "exempt dealer" to enable the Minister to prescribe any
person or class of persons as an exempt dealer. In addition, paragraph
_(e) of the definition is amended consequential to the amendment of_
the definition of "fund manager".

_Clause 3 also seeks to amend the definition of "fund manager"_

to rationalise the regulatory framework relating to fund management
activities and consequential to the amendment of the definition of
"futures fund management business" in the Futures Industry Act

1993 and "unit trust scheme" in the Securities Commission Act
1993.

The deletion of the definition of "Registrar" is proposed consequent

to the rationalisation of the regulatory structure of the securities
industry. Apart from this deletion, this Bill also seeks to remove all
references to the Registrar in sections 2, 10, 33, 34, 35, 49, 50, 94A,
95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 and 126 of the Act.

Other amendments to section 2 of the Act proposed in clause 3

are—


_(a) the amendment of the definition of "securities" to make_

it consistent with the definition of "securities" in the
Securities Commission Act 1993;

_(b) the deletion of the definition of "stock broker" is consequent_

to the removal of references to "stock brokers" from sections
2, 14, 39, 89 and 120 of the Act;

_(c) the amendment of the definition of "stock market" to clarify_

the meaning of the term when used in the Act;

make it consistent with the definition of "unit trust scheme"
in the Securities Commision Act 1993; and

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend subsection 14(2) of the Act to clarify_
that a fund manager does not require an investment adviser's licence
when carrying on a business of giving investment advice.

6. Clause 10 seeks to amend section 41 of the Act by deleting the
reference to a purchaser in subsection 41(1). With this amendment
securities traded in the short-term money market are exempted from
the application of this section. It also seeks to introduce a new
paragraph (e) to enable the Minister to further declare a sale of
securities that are not subject to this section.

7. _Clause 11 seeks to amend the English language text of subsection_
44(1A) of the Act to replace the word "trading" with "business" to

the provisions on dealing in securities and property consistent with
the other provisions of the section.

9. Clauses 15, 23 and 26 seek to divide Part IX into Divisions 1,
2 and 3. Division 1 which deals with prohibited conduct will contain
sections 84 to 88A. Division 2 which deals with insider trading will
contain sections 89 to 89o. Division 3 which deals with liability for
unlawful activity will contain sections 90 to 93.

10. Clause 21 seeks to introduce a new section 87B into the Act
to empower the Minister to prescribe the persons to whom sections
84, 85, 86, 87 and 87 A of the Act do not apply and to make regulation
in respect thereof.

11. Clause 22 seeks to introduce new sections 88A and 88B into
the Act to provide for civil liability and penalty for the contravention
of sections 84, 85, 86, 87, 87A and 88.

12. _Clause 24 seeks to amend section 89 of the Act to set out what_

89E, 89F, 89G, 89H, 89I, 89J, 89K, 89L, 89M, 89N and 89o into the

trading.

to investigate dealings in securities that are carried out on another
person's behalf, the duty to notify the Securities Commission of a
person's interest in a listed corporation, the application by the Securities
Commission to the High Court to disqualify a person as a director

clarify that an employer is liable for the act of his employees who
contravene any provision of the Act.

the word "wilfully". With this deletion it is no longer necessary to
prove wilfulness as an ingredient for an offence under that section.
The section is also redrafted to make its meaning clearer.

20. The amendment in clause 42 is made necessary by the decision
in the case of Repco Holdings Bhd. v. Public Prosecutor (1997).

21. Clause 43 seeks to introduce a new section 126c into the Act
to enable the Securities Commission to be represented in any civil
proceedings by any officer of the Commission authorised by the
Commission for such purpose.

consequential in nature.
