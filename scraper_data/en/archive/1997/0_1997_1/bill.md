EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to make provision for, and to regulate the use of,
digital signatures and to provide for matters connected therewith.

2. Part I contains preliminary matters.

_Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the_
commencement of the proposed Act.

_Clause 2 contains the definitions of several expressions used in_
the proposed Act.

3. Part II deals with the Controller of Certification Authorities
and the licensing of certification authorities.

_Clause 3 seeks to empower the Minister to appoint a Controller_
of Certification Authorities. It also seeks to empower the Controller,
after consultation with the Minister, to appoint such number of
officers and servants as the Controller considers necessary. The
function of the Controller is primarily to license certification authorities
and to monitor and oversee the activities of certification authorities.

_Clause 4 seeks to introduce a mandatory licensing scheme for_
certification authorities. The mandatory licensing scheme is proposed
to establish a minimum regulatory system to provide a basic level
of reliability in certification authority practice without undermining
the reliability of any signature by invalidating it for lack of a regulatory
licence. Under the proposed scheme, a digital signature may
nevertheless be reliable and legally valid if verified by a certificate
issued by an unlicensed certification authority or without verification
by any certificate at all. However, in such cases and as expressly
provided in clause 13 of the proposed Act, neither the liability
limits specified in Chapter 8 of Part IV of the proposed Act nor
Part V of the proposed Act shall apply.


-----

#### Bill

_Subclause 4(3) seeks to allow the Minister to exempt a person_

operating as a certification authority within an organisation where
certificates and key pairs are issued to members of the organisation
for internal use only and such other person or class of persons as
the Minister considers fit.

_Clause 5 seeks to empower the Minister to prescribe the qualification_

requirements for certification authorities by regulations made under
the proposed Act.

_Clause 6 seeks to make provision for the functions of licensed_

certification authorities. It also seeks to impose a duty on the licensed
certification authority to take all reasonable measures to check for
proper identification of a subscriber before issuing a certificate.

_Clauses 7 to 11 seek to make provision for the application for_

licences and the issue, surrender and revocation of licences.

_Clause 12 seeks to provide for the effect of the revocation, surrender_

or expiry of licences, Subclauses 12(5) to (8) seek to make provision
for the certificates issued by a certification authority where its licence
has been revoked or surrendered or has expired.

_Clause 13 seeks to clarify the effect of the lack of a licence, that_

is, Chapter 8 of Part IV of the proposed Act will not apply to the
unlicensed certification authority and Part V of the proposed Act
will not apply in relation to a digital signature which cannot be
verified by a certificate issued by a licensed certification authority.

_Clause 14 seeks to require the return of revoked or expired licences._

_Clause 15 seeks to allow the Controller to classify licences according_

to specified limitations and provides that where a licensed certification
authority issues a certificate exceeding the restrictions of its licence,
the licensed certification authority commits an offence. Further,

the liability limits specified in Chapter 8 of Part IV shall not apply
to it. However, this shall not affect the validity or effect of the

issued certificate.

_Clause 16 seeks to restrict the use of the expression "certification_

authority" and "licensed certification authority".

_Clause 17 seeks to provide for the renewal of licences whilst_

_clause 18 seeks to provide for the replacement of lost licences._


-----

#### Digital Signature

_Clause 19 seeks to allow the Controller, by order published in_
the Gazette, to recognise foreign certification authorities thereby
allowing the recommended reliance limits specified in the certificates
issued by the foreign certification authorities to apply and Part V
of the proposed Act to apply to the certificates issued by it.

_Clause 20 seeks to provide for performance audits of licensed_
certification authorities to evaluate its compliance with the proposed
Act. Clause 21 seeks to provide limited exemptions from performance
audits to small businesses.

4. Part III (clauses 22 to 26) deals with the requirements imposed
on licensed certification authorities and includes requiring the licensed
certification authority to only carry on activities specified in its
licence, to display its licence and to submit information relating to
its business operations.

5. Part IV (clauses 27 to 61) deals with the duties of licensed
certification authorities and subscribers. The duties of a licensed
certification authority include using a trustworthy system to issue,
suspend or revoke a certificate, to publish or give notice thereof
and to create a private key, to publish issued and accepted certificates
and to suspend or revoke certificates immediately where the need
arises. Clause 31 provides that a licensed certification authority
may conform to standards, certification practice statements, security
plans or contractual requirements more rigorous than the proposed
Act provided that they are not inconsistent therewith.

The duties of a subscriber include retaining control of the private
key and practising safe key management. Clause 44 provides that
the private key is the personal property of the subscriber who rightfully
holds it.

_Clauses 34 to 42 seek to provide the warranties and obligations_
of the licensed certification authority and subscriber on the issue
and acceptance of a certificate.

_Clauses 60 and 61 seek to provide for a recommended reliance_
limit. By specifying a recommended reliance limit in a certificate,
the issuing certification authority and accepting subscriber recommend
that a person rely on the certificate only to the extent that the total
amount at risk does not exceed the recommended reliance limit.

6. Part V deals with the effect of digital signatures.


-----

#### Bill

_Clause 62 seeks to provide that a digital signature created in_

accordance with the proposed Act shall satisfy the requirements of
law with respect to signatures and that notwithstanding any written
law to the contrary, a document signed with a digital signature in
accordance with the proposed Act shall be as legally binding as a
document signed with a handwritten signature, an affixed thumb-
print or any other mark. However, the proposed Act does not
preclude any symbol from being valid as a signature under any
other applicable law.

_Clause 63 seeks to provide that the recipient of a digital signature_

assumes the risk that a digital signature is forged if under the
circumstances reliance on it is not reasonable. It also seeks to impose
a duty on the recipient who does not rely on a digital signature to
notify the signer of its determination and the grounds for that
determination.

_Clause 64 seeks to deem a digitally signed document to be a_

written document whilst clause 65 seeks to deem a digitally signed
document to be an original document.

_Clause 66 seeks to provide for the authentication of digital_

signatures.

_Clause 67 seeks to provide certain presumptions in adjudicating_

disputes.

7. Part VI deals with repositories and date/time stamp services.

_Clauses 68 and 69 seek to provide for the recognition of repositories_

and their liabilities.

_Clause 70 seeks to provide for the recognition of date/time stamp_

services.

8. Part VII deals with general matters.

_Clause 72 seeks to impose an obligation of secrecy on persons_

who have access to confidential information obtained under the
proposed Act.

_Clause 73 seeks to make it an offence to furnish untrue, inaccurate_

or misleading information.

_Clause 74 seeks to provide for offences committed by a body_

corporate.

_Clause 75 seeks to empower the Minister to authorise any public_

officer or officer of the Controller to exercise the powers of
enforcement under the proposed Act.


-----

_Digital Signature_

_Clauses 76 to 82 seek to give the Controller powers relating to_

investigation, search and seizure.

_Clause 83 seeks to provide a general penalty for contravention_

of the proposed Act of a fine not exceeding two hundred thousand
ringgit or imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years or
both, and in the case of a continuing offence, a daily fine not
exceeding two thousand ringgit for each day the offence continues
to be committed.

_Clause 84 seeks to empower the Controller to recover the costs_

incurred in relation to prosecution and adjudication proceedings.

_Clause 85 seeks to provide that costs or damages arising from a_

proper exercise of the powers of seizure under the proposed Act
shall not be recoverable.

_Clause 86 seeks to provide that a prosecution for an offence_

under the proposed Act shall only be instituted with the written
consent of the Public Prosecutor.

_Clause 87 seeks to provide that notwithstanding any written law_

to the contrary, a Court of a Magistrate of the First Class shall have

jurisdiction to try any offence under the proposed Act and to impose

the full punishment for any such offence.

_Clause 89 seeks to empower the Minister to exempt any person_

or class of persons from all or any of the provisions of the proposed
Act, except section 4.

_Clause 91 seeks to empower the Minister to make regulations._

_Subclause 91(2) seeks to provide that the regulations may prescribe_
penalties of a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand ringgit or

imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both for a
contravention of the regulations.

_Clause 92 seeks to provide savings and transitional provisions._

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure
the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.
