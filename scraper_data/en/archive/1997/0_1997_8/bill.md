EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to facilitate the corporatisation of Bank Simpanan
Nasional by providing for the transfer to and for the vesting of
property, rights and liabilities of Bank Simpanan Nasional in a
company by the name of Bank Simpanan Nasional Berhad (hereinafter
referred to as the "Bank"), its regulation and to make provisions
for other matters relating thereto. The corporatisation of the Bank
will give it a suitable structure and the capability to operate more
effectively, smoothly and with great flexibility. The Bank Simpanan
Nasional's primary motivation for corporatisation is to improve its
financial performance and service performance. It also seeks to lay
the foundation for sustainable and viable growth.

company under the Companies Act 1965. Currently, the Bank
Simpanan Nasional is governed by an Act of Parliament and is
supervised by the Minister of Finance who sets the general policy
direction of the Bank. Under a corporatised status, the Bank will
still be governed by an Act of Parliament but the proposed Act will
reflect the new status and objectives of the Bank. The Bank is not
under the purview of the Banking and Financial Institutions Act

1989 as the Bank is not a licensed Bank. The Bank selectively

adopts the provisions of the Banking and Financial Institutions Act

1989 in the proposed Act.
