EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Copyright Act 1987 ("the Act").

2. Technological development, especially information technology,
has challenged traditional concepts of copyright protection. The
proposed establishment of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)
will, generate both challenges and opportunities for Malaysia. The
success of the MSC will, to a certain extent, be determined by the
contents that move through it. These include educational works,


-----

8 _Bill_

entertainment products and information that are protected under the
copyright law. For the MSC to realise its full potential, it is essential
that adequate legal protection be made available to these works.
The Act is proposed to be amended towards this end, taking into
account recent international developments in respect of certain
copyright works.

3. Clause 2 seeks to make various amendments to the interpretation
section of the Act. The terms "fixation" and "literary work" are
amended and the term ".communication to the public" is introduced
so as to be in line with recent international developments. The

term "broadcast" has been redefined to accommodate any future
technological development. In relation to this, the definition of
"author" in relation to a broadcast has also been amended to ensure
that only a person having responsibility for the selection of the
content of the broadcast is recognized as the author. This will

ensure" that a person merely transmitting a broadcast will not be
considered the author'of the broadcast.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 7 of the Act to exclude ideas,_

procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts from
the realm of copyright.

5. _Clause 4(a)(i) seeks to amend subsection 13(1) of the Act to_

provide for the nature of copyright in derivative works. With this
amendment, the exclusive rights of the author of a derivative work
are made clear. Clause 4(a)(ii) stipulates that an author has the
exclusive right to "communicate to the public" his work and by
virtue of the definition, this includes making it available in a way
that members of the public may access the work from a place and
at a time individually chosen by them. Clause 4(a)(iii) is an amendment
consequential to the introduction of the exclusive right to communicate
to the public. Clause 4(a)(iv) provides for an author's right over
the sale or other transfer of ownership of his work whilst clause
_4(a)(v) provides for his right over commercial rental of his work._
_Clause 4(b)(i) seeks to exclude from an author's right of control_
certain uses of television broadcasts by people who are physically

or mentally handicapped. Clause 4(b)(iii) seeks to limit an author's
exclusive right over the commercial rental of computer programs.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend subsection 15(2) of the Act as 'a_

consequence of the new exemption provided in respect of people
who are physically or mentally handicapped.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to include photographs within the ambit of section_

17 which deals with the duration of copyright in literary, musical

or artistic works. As a consequence to that, the existing section 21
on the duration of copyright in respect of photographs is deleted
_(clause 7)._


-----

_Copyright (Amendment)_ _9_

8. Clause 8 seeks to amend subsection 25(2) of the Act to make
it clear that an author has the right to be identified and has moral
right against the mutilation and distortion of his works.

9. Clause 9 seeks to provide for copyright infringement through
circumvention of effective technological measures and removal or
alteration of electronic rights management information without
authority.

10. _Clause 10 seeks to provide for new offences._

11. _Clause 12 empowers the Minister to exclude certain services_
from the scope of broadcast in relation to a transmission by wire.

12. Other amendments not specifically referred to are minor or
consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1978.]
