EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The proposed Water Supply (Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur)
Act 1997 ("the Act") seeks to provide for the law to be made
applicable to the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur ("Federal
Territory") on matters relating to the supply and distribution of
water in the event that the water supply service is privatised both
in the Federal Territory and in the State of Selangor.

2. Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title and commencement
of the Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to provide that the law relating to the supply
and distribution of water in the State of Selangor shall apply to the
Federal Territory but with the necessary modifications.

4. Clause 3 seeks to provide that the authority responsible for the
supply and distribution of water in the State of Selangor shall be
the authority responsible, on behalf of the Government of the
Federation, for such matters in the Federal Territory. However, this
does not preclude the Government of the Federation from exercising
on its own behalf, its powers and functions which have been conferred
upon the authority in the State of Selangor by this Act.
