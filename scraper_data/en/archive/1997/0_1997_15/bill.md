_Interpretation (Amendment)_ 5

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Interpretation Acts 1948 and 1967
("Act 388").

_Amendments in relation to subsidiary legislation_

_2. On 18 December 1996 the Federal Court, in the case of Wong_
_Pot Heng and Hj. Rosli bin Haji Kamaruddin and the Government_
_of Malaysia ("Wong Pot Heng's case") decided that the provisions_
of section 20 of Act 388 do not enable subsidiary legislation to be
made to operate retrospectively in the absence of an express provision
in the Act under which the legislation is made allowing such
retrospective operation.

3. Since the coming into force of section 20 of Act 388 on 18

May 1967, countless subsidiary legislation have been made to operate
retrospectively. The proviso to that section protects a person from
penalty for an act done before the date of publication of the subsidiary
legislation.

4. It has always been the view of the Government that section 20

of Act 388 is sufficiently clear to enable retrospective subsidiary
legislation to be made and the effect of that section had never been
questioned in any court of law in Malaysia until the decision of
the Federal Court in the Wong Pot Heng's case.

5. The decision of the Federal Court in the Wong Pot Heng's case
has made it necessary for an amendment to be made to section 20,
in particular, and to sections 23 and 25 of Act 388 to make it clear
that where a power is given in any written law to make subsidiary
legislation, that legislation may be made (subject to the proviso
mentioned above) to operate retrospectively despite the absence of
express provision to that effect in the written law under which the
legislation is made. These amendments are contained in clauses 8,
_9, and 10 of this Bill._

6. Clause 11 contains an amendment to section 27 of Act 388 to
make it clear that the scope of that section includes the creation
of offences under subsidiary legislation.

_Amendments in relation to the construction of written laws_

_1._ The amendment to the iong title of Act 388 (as proposed in

_clause 4) seeks to make it clear that the scope of Act 388 is not_
merely limited to the meanings of words used in written laws.


-----

## 6 Bill

8. _Clause 6 of this Bill seeks to amend section 15 of Act 388 to_

make it clear that the preamble to and long title of an Act form
part of the Act. Although they have always been accepted as such,
Act 388 does not contain express provisions to that effect.

9. Clause 7 of this Bill seeks to introduce a new section I7A into
Act 388 which provides that an Act ought to be interpreted by
giving it the construction which would promote the underlying purpose
of the Act.

_Other amendments_

10. This Bill also seeks to amend several definitions in section

3 of Act 388.

The amendments proposed to the definition of "Lord President"

(which is to be changed to that of the "Chief Justice") and to the
definition of "Rules Committee" are amendments in consequence
of amendments made to the Federal Constitution in 1994.

The amendment to the definition of "West Malaysia" is an

amendment in consequence of the establishment of the Federal
Territory of Kuala Lumpur in 1974. Apart from adding the Federal
Territory of Kuala Lumpur to the definition, the amendment also
proposes to replace the term "West Malaysia" with the term
"Peninsular Malaysia" to reflect current usage.

The amendment to the definition of "writing" is proposed to

facilitate the use of electronic means in the recording of information.

The object of facilitating the use of electronic means is also the

reason underlying the proposed new section 62A (in clause 12).

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1997.]
