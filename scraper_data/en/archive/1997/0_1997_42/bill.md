7. _Clause 4 seeks to empower the Labuan Offshore Financial_
Services Authority (the "Authority") to keep separate registers for
private funds, public funds and managers and administrators of public
funds and sets out the information to be contained in such registers.
The clause goes on to authorise the Authority to determine the
form of such registers, provides that the registers shall be open to
inspection on payment of a fee and authorises the Authority to
issue certificates of compliance. Subclause 4(5) seeks to prohibit
any person involved in the administration of the proposed Act from
having any financial interest either in any mutual fund or in any
entity concerned in the administration thereof.

8. _Clause 5 seeks to impose a duty on the Authority to enter in_
the registers referred to in clause 4 particulars relating to private
funds granted consent under clause 8, public funds registered or
granted provisional acceptance under clause 11 and managers and
administrators granted a licence under clause 14. The Authority is
also required to issue certification of its approvals and to record in
the registers any written permissions issued under subclause 3(2),
or subclause 12(2) in the case of acceptable non-Labuan applicants.

9. _Clause 6 seeks to prohibit a private fund from operating in_
Labuan without the Authority's consent.

10. _Clause 7 seeks to require a private fund to provide sufficient_
details in support of its application, the requisite fee and satisfactory
proof of it being lawfully constituted.

at the discretion of the Authority and to be able to be made subject
to conditions.

12. _Clause 9 seeks to prohibit a public fund from operating in_
Labuan unless it is registered under clause 11.

13. Clause 10 seeks to require an applicant or the promoters for
the proposed public fund to provide sufficient details in support of
its application, the requisite fee and satisfactory proof of it being
lawfully constituted.

14. _Clause 11 seeks to provide for the grant or refusal of registration_
of a public fund and provisional acceptance of a proposed public
fund to be at the discretion of the Authority and to be able to be
made subject to conditions. This clause also provides for a three
months' period of validity of provisional acceptance and enables
that period to be extended.

15. _Clause 12 seeks to require any Labuan manager of a mutual_

fund to be a corporate entity registered in Labuan and duly licensed
under clause 14 unless the person is qualified to be a manager
under the laws of any recognised country or jurisdiction and has
received written permission from the Authority. Subclause 12(1)(b)
requires that an administrator be registered.

16. _Clause 13 seeks to require a prospective manager of a public_

fund to apply to the Authority for a licence and to provide the
requisite fee, details of its resources and facilities, information under
_clause 21 and such other items as the Authority might reasonably_
require. Subclause 13(3) requires an administrator to apply for
registration in the prescribed form.

17. Clause 14 seeks to give the Authority discretion in the grant

of a licence or registration save that the Authority must not grant
a licence or registration unless it is satisfied as to the fitness and
resources of the applicant. The Authority may impose conditions to
a licence or registration and the Authority's consent is required to
any change in the status of the licensee.

18. _Clause 15 seeks to require and empower the Authority to_

supervise mutual funds, managers and administrators and to delegate
its powers and duties to any person.

19. _Clause 16 seeks to make provision for the maintenance,_

publication, audit and inspection of records and accounts of public
funds and for accounts to be kept in any currency and language
provided that a translation into the national language or the English
language is kept available.

20. _Clause 17 seeks to impose a duty on a registered public fund_

to publish and file with the Authority a prospectus signed and approved
by the operators of the public fund prior to offering its shares to the
public. The prospectus must make full disclosure as to all relevant
circumstances, contain a statement summarising investor's rights
and contain reference to the availability of its most recent accounts.
An expert's certificate is required before the Authority may accept
a prospectus for filing and, if it is not in the national language or
English language a translation must be provided. Any material change
in the matters required to be disclosed must be published to investors
and to the Authority within twenty-one days. It also seeks to make
sections 28 to 39 inclusive, of the Offshore Companies Act 1990
relating to prospectus, inapplicable in this context.

21. _Clause 18 seeks to give rights to investors in a public fund to_

apply for rescission or damages in respect of any misrepresentation
in a prospectus.

24. _Clause 21 seeks to impose a duty on the applicant to supply_

accept service, the address of any place of business it may have
outside Labuan and to notify the Authority within twenty-one days
of any change in any of the details supplied.

cancelled and to be prima facie evidence of their contents.

consent, licence or registration, either at the request of the holder
or in the event of the holder's ceasing to carry on business,
contravention of the proposed Act, conviction of an offence, wilful
supply of misleading information, the carrying on of business in a
manner detrimental to investors or upon bankruptcy or dissolution.

27. _Clause 24 seeks to provide for an opportunity to be heard in_
the event that revocation is proposed under clause 23 and for any
revocation to take effect upon delivery by the Authority of a notice
of the revocation.

28. _Clause 25 seeks to provide that the Authority is not obliged_
to give reasons for its decision on any application. It also provides
that appeals may be brought against the revocation of a consent,
licence or registration. The bringing of an appeal will have the
effect of suspending the decision appealed from pending its
determination and the appellant shall not carry on any business or
activity without prior written consent of the Authority.

29. _Clause 26 seeks to prescribe a period of twenty-one days for_
bringing an appeal, by summons before a court of competent
