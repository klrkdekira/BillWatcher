SCHEDULE

(Section 7)

FORMULA FOR RENTAL

1. The amount of rental to be paid monthly by the tenant to the

landlord shall be on a gradated increase as follows:

Year 1 - R plus 1/4 (M - R)

Year 2 - R plus 1/2 (M - R)

Year 3 - R plus 3/4 (M - R)

2. Year 1 shall be deemed to be the period commencing on

1 September 1997 and ending on 31 December 1997 or the expiry

of the transitional period, whichever is earlier.

3. Year 2 shall be deemed to be the period commencing on

1 January 1998 and ending on 31 December 1998 or the expiry of

the transitional period, whichever is earlier.

4. Year 3 shall be deemed to be the period commencing on

1 January 1999 and ending on 31 December 1999 or the expiry of

the transitional period, whichever is earlier.

5. For purposes of computation—

_(a) "R" is the fair rent prevailing before the repeal of the_

Act; and

_(b) "M" is the monthly rentable value of the premises fixed_

at one-twelfth of the annual value of the property as
assessed by the local authority in which the property is
situated, represented by the following formula:

M = 1 x (amount of annual rate payable for the year)

12 ———————————————————————————
(percentage of the annual rate as assessed by
the local authority for the year)

_Illustration_

1. If the prevailing fair rent before the repeal of the Act is RM50,

then R = RM50

2. If the annual rate payable for the year is RM108 and the percentage
of the annual rate is 6 per centum per annum,

then M = 1/12 x (108/6%)

= 1/12 x 1,800
= RM150


-----

## Control of Rent (Repeal) 9

3. Therefore M - R = RM(150 - 50) = RM100

4. The monthly rental to be paid by the tenant to the landlord on

the gradated increase based on paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 will be—

_(a) Year 1_ = 50 + (1/4 x 100)

= 5 0 + 2 5

= RM75

_(b) Year 2_ = 50 + (1/2 x 100)

= 5 0 + 5 0

= RM100

_(c) Year 3_ = 50 + (3/4 x 100)

= 50 + 75

= RM125

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to repeal the Control of Rent Act 1966 ("the Act").
With the passage of time, the Act, which was originally enacted
in 1966 to regulate and control the rental of privately owned buildings
built before 31 January 1948 owing to the shortage of housing
during the post-war period, has since outlived its usefulness. On
the contrary, it has lent itself to abuse with the further subletting
of the controlled premises by the tenants at the expense of the
landlords. It is now felt that the time has come for the Act to cease
to operate, and for the landlords to be able to recover possession
of the controlled premises for purposes of development. However,
to alleviate the immediate need for alternative housing consequent
upon the repeal and to facilitate adjustments by tenants to payment
of rental at market rates, a transitional period is provided for. At
the end of the transitional period landlords are entitled to recover
vacant possession of the premises.

PART I

2. Part I contains preliminary matters.

3. Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title and commencement
of the proposed Act.

PART II

4. Part II contains provisions relating to the repeal of the Act.


-----

## 10 Bill

_5. Clause 2 repeals the Act._

6. Under clause 3, all tenancies between landlords and tenants
before the repeal are deemed to have ceased upon the repeal of the
Act.

7. Clause 4 is a savings provision.

PART III

8. Part III contains transitional provisions.

9. _Clause 5 deals with the duration of the transitional period_

consequent upon the repeal of the Act. That period shall be from

1 September 1997 to 31 December 1999. Under subclause (2), the

transitional period may expire earlier than 31 December 1999 in
any State or the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur.

10. _Clause 6 seeks to deem any tenant, sub-tenant or joint-tenant_

who was in actual and lawful occupation of the premises on the
date of the repeal of the Act to have entered into a tenancy with
the landlord as from the date of the repeal until the expiry of the
transitional period. This deeming provision is a device to enlarge
time for tenants to obtain alternative accommodation before the
effects of the repeal of the Act become absolute on 1 January 2000.

11. _Clause 7 seeks to provide for the amount of rental to be paid_

by the tenant to the landlord under the deemed tenancy. The rental
on a gradated increase determined for the transitional period as
provided in the Schedule seeks to give the landlord returns which
are higher than the fair rent payable before the repeal, but short
of rental at market value for the premises. The gradated increase
acts as a form of "compensation" to the landlord for the delayed
recovery of the possession of the premises.

12. _Clause 8 seeks to provide an avenue to the landlord for the_

recovery of possession of the premises during the transitional period
without compensation in the event of non-payment or arrears of
rental by the tenant.

13. _Clause 9 seeks to prohibit the recovery of vacant possession_

of premises by the landlord for any reason, including one on ground
of development, except for the right to vacant possession under
_clause 8. This prohibition is necessary so as not to defeat the objective_
of the transitional period.

14. Under clause 10, a De-control Tribunal is established to

adjudicate disputes concerning rentals due and owing to the landlord
and the recovery of vacant possession of premises under clause 8.


-----

_Control of Rent (Repeal)_ 11

By subclause (2), the Rent Tribunal established under section 12
of the Act is the De-control Tribunal and by subclause (3), members
of the Rent Tribunal shall be deemed to be members of the De-
control Tribunal.

15. _Clause 11 deals with the expiry of the transitional period._

Upon such expiry, all deemed tenancies under clause 6 shall cease
to be in force and the landlords shall thereafter have the right to
vacant possession of the premises without payment of compensation.
In the exercise of such a right, the landlord shall serve on the tenant
a notice to vacate the premises under subclause (2), and the manner
in which it is to be served is provided in subclause (3).

16. The Minister may make rules under clause 12 for the purpose

of facilitating the implementation of Part III.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1649/11.]
