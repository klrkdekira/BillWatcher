## 4 Bill

The term "surviving husband or wife" has been changed to "surviving
spouse" to reflect the distribution of the intestate's property based
on gender equality.

The provision in clear terms of the rights of the surviving parents
in the distribution of the property of an intestate is consistent with
the objective of creating a caring society.

4. Clause 4 deals with savings provision.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1844.]
