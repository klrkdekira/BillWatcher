**EXPLANATORY STATEMENT**

This Bill seeks to consolidate the existing laws relating to the
prevention of corruption and to make new and better provisions, in
particular relating to the powers of investigation, to enable the country
to deal with acts of corruption.

2. The laws which this Bill seeks to replace are the Prevention of
Corruption Act 1961 ("Act 57"), the Anti-Corruption Agency Act
1982 and the Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance No. 22, 1970
("Ordinance 22").

3. Part I of the Bill deals with preliminary matters.

_Clause 1 seeks to empower the Minister to appoint the date for_
the coming into force of the proposed Act.

_Clause 2 contains the definitions of words and expressions used_
in this Bill.

4. Part II contains provisions relating to the establishment of the
Anti-Corruption Agency ("the Agency"), its officers and their powers.

_Clause 3 contains provisions for the establishment of the Agency_
and the appointment of the Director-General, while clause 4 contains
provisions for the appointment of other officers of the Agency.

_Clauses 7 and 8 set out the powers and functions of the officers_
of the Agency, while clauses 5, 6 and 9 provide for matters which
need to be observed by such officers generally when carrying out
their functions under the proposed Act.

5. Part III contains the main offences and penalties in relation to
corruption. Such offences are basically the offences now provided
for in Part II of Act 57. Clauses 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 of the
Bill correspond to sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of Act 57. Clause 16
contains an offence based on section 2 of Ordinance 22.

## Anti-Corruption 59

However, it is proposed in this Bill that the penalties be increased.

The most severe penalty under Part II of Act 57 is a maximum

fine of ten thousand ringgit or imprisonment for a maximum term
of seven years or both. The penalties proposed in clause 17 of this
Bill are imprisonment for a minimum term of six months and a
maximum term of twenty years and a fine of not less than five
times the value of the gratification offered or received, if it is
capable of being valued or ten thousand ringgit, whichever is the
higher.

It is proposed that the courts be still left with the discretion

whether to bind over the accused under section 173A or 294 of the
Criminal Procedure Code.

Part III also seeks to require a person to whom gratification is

offered or any person from whom gratification is requested for to
report such offer or request. This is contained in clause 18.

Under clause 19, a person commits an offence if he deals with,

uses, holds or conceals any property which is the subject-matter of
any of the offences proposed in clauses 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16.

_Clause 20 seeks to make it an offence for any person to make_

any statement which is false or which is intended to mislead to an
officer of the Agency or the Public Prosecutor who is exercising
powers under the proposed Act.

_Clause 21 seeks to make every attempt, preparation, abetment_

and criminal conspiracy to commit an offence under the proposed
Act punishable with the same penalty as provided for such offence.

and arrest.

investigate reports and to inquire into any report.

search any premises, to search any person found therein, to stop,
examine and seize any conveyance, and to detain any person found
in any premises or conveyance until the search of the premises or
conveyance is completed.

Prosecutor is also to be given the power to require any relative or
associate of such person to give similar information. Failure to
furnish such information will be an offence.

Under clause 33 also, if the Public Prosecutor has reason to

believe that a person who has been required to furnish information
