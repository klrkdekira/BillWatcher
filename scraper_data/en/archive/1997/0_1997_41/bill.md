commencement.

3. Clause 2 seeks to introduce a new section 73A into the principal

has knowingly facilitated the forgery or the making of the unauthorized
signature, that signature shall be deemed to be his signature.

Act. Under the new section 74A, a cheque can be presented for
payment through a document image processing system.

it clear that the protection for paying bankers under that section is
applicable to payment of non-transferable cheques under the proposed
new section 8lA.

Act. Subsection (1) of the proposed new section makes it clear that
a cheque which is crossed and bears the words "account payee"

new section provides that a banker is not negligent if he fails to
concern himself with any indorsement on any non-transferable cheque
