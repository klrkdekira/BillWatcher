## 2 Bill

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend section 3 of the Notaries Public Act 1959.

2. Before the amendment to section 3 which came into force on

1 August 1991, when a notary public was appointed, the period of

his appointment was not specified. As such, that person is a notary
public for the rest of his life. His appointment may only be revoked
under section 5 on the ground that his name has been struck off
the roll of advocates and solicitors or he has exercised any of the
functions of a notary public outside his place of practice.

3. After the amendment to section 3 made in 1991, the appointment
of a notary public is limited to a specified period.

4. The amendment proposed to section 3 by this Bill will remove
the unequal treatment of notaries public for which there is no basis
and bring about uniformity in the period of appointment of notaries
public in this country.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1959.]
