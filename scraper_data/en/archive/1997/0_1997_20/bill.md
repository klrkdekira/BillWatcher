This Bill seeks to amend the Land Acquisition Act 1960 ("the Act").

2. Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title to the Bill and its
commencement and application.


-----

28 _Bill_

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act by introducing_
a few new definitions which are considered necessary, such as the
definitions of "Committee", "development approval", "Economic
Planning Unit" ("EPU"), "public utility", "sewerage system" and
"valuer". The definition of "building" has been expanded to make
its meaning more specific and clearer. The definition of
"Commissioner" has been replaced by the definition of "State
Director". The definition of "person interested" has been amended
to exclude from its meaning a tenant at will.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 3 of the Act. The existing_
section 3 is renumbered as subsection (I). Paragraph 3(l)(c) is
amended to provide for an acquisition of land which is for recreational
purposes or for a combination of any of the purposes provided
therein. The amendment to section 3 also seeks to provide for the
procedure in making an application for acquisition under paragraph
3(1)(b) or (c). Upon receipt of an application, the Land Administrator
shall transmit it with the accompanying documents to the State
EPU, or the Committee for the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur
("Committee for F.T.K.L."), in the case of an application made in
the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. The Land Administrator is
empowered to reject any application which does not conform to the
requirements provided in subsection (3). Under subsection (6), the
Land Administrator shall also reject any application where in respect
of the land to be acquired there is a development approval granted
to the registered proprietor and the acquisition is not for the purpose
of public utility. This is in view of the fact that the State Authority
shall not consider any such application.

5. Clause 4 seeks to introduce the new sections 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D,
3E and 3F.

The proposed section 3A provides for the State EPU or the
Committee for F.T.K.L., as the case may be, to consider the application
on the various aspects provided. Where there is a development approval
granted in respect of the land and the acquisition is for the purpose
of public utility, the State EPU or the Committee for F.T.K.L. shall,
if appropriate, give directions to the applicant to negotiate with the
registered proprietor on the form of co-operation or commercial
arrangement for the sharing of profits in the project. The applicant
is then required to submit a report of the negotiations to the State
EPU or the Committee for F.T.K.L., as the case may be.

Where negotiations are successful then it shall not be necessary
for the State EPU or the Committee for F.T.K.L. to proceed further
with the application for acquisition.

Where negotiations have been unsuccessful, the State EPU or
the Committee for F.T.K.L. may proceed to consider the application
and make any recommendation as it deems fit.


-----

_Land Acquisition (Amendment)_ 29

After the State EPU or the Committee for F.T.K.L. has considered
each application under the section, it shall then transmit the application
to the Committee, in the case of a State, or to the State Authority,
in the case of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur.

The proposed section 3B provides for the application of section
3A where there is no development approval in respect of the land
to be acquired. Here, the power of the State EPU, or the Committee
for F.T.K.L., to require the applicant to negotiate with the registered
proprietor in the project is only discretionary in nature.

The proposed section 3C provides for the establishment of the
Jawatankuasa Khas Pengambilan Tanah ("Committee").

The proposed section 3D provides for the evaluation of the
application by the Committee, in the case of a State, after which
it will be forwarded to the State Authority.

The proposed section 3 E empowers the State Authority to approve
or reject the application and for the applicant to be informed
accordingly. It also provides that the State Authority shall not approve
the application for the acquisition of land, for any purpose, larger
in area than that needed for that purpose. Under subsection (3) the
applicant is required to confirm his acceptance of the terms and
conditions of the approval imposed by the State Authority within
thirty days of the notification otherwise the applicant is deemed to
have withdrawn the application.

The proposed section 3F enables the applicant to withdraw from
the acquisition of any land before the publication of the declaration
under section 8. It also covers the situation where the applicant is
deemed to have withdrawn his application under subsection 3E(3).
In all such cases, the Land Administrator shall conduct an enquiry
to determine the amount of deposit to be forfeited for the payment
of compensation to the persons interested.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to substitute for the word "Commissioner" in_
subsection 5(1) the words "State Director".

7. _Clause 6 seeks to introduce a new subsection 8(5) to empower_
the Land Administrator to pay compensation to any person injured
after the declaration under subsection (1) has lapsed on the expiry
of two years after its publication in the Gazette.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend subsection 9(2) by deleting the words_
"In States other than the States of Penang and Malacca" as it is
no longer necessary to differentiate the other States from Penang
and Malacca in matters relating to the making of any note on any
intended acquisition in the register.


-----

30 _Bill_

9. Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section 9A to the Act. This
section is intended to enable the Land Administrator to obtain
information from the State Director of Town and Country Planning
or the Commissioner of the City of Kuala Lumpur, as the case may
be, stating whether the scheduled land is within a local planning
authority area and whether there is a development plan or land use
indicated in the development plan for the scheduled land. The Director
or the Commissioner, as the case may be, is required to submit the
information within four weeks of the request being made by the
Land Administrator. Accordingly, the local planning authority is
given two weeks to provide the information to the Director. Subsection
(6) provides that non-compliance with the time period stipulated
for the information to be obtained shall not invalidate the
acquisition or the award. These amendments are related to the
amendment to the First Schedule where a new subparagraph 1(2BA)
will be introduced.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to amend subsection 12(1) by inserting a new_
proviso to provide that the Land Administrator may obtain a
written opinion on the value of all scheduled lands from a valuer
prior to making an award under section 14.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend subsection 14(5) to include valuation_
fees as part of the costs incurred for the proceedings before the
Land Administrator.

12. _Clause 11 seeks to amend section 19 to empower the Land_
Administrator to issue a certificate of urgency in respect of an
acquisition under paragraph 3(l)(b) where it is for public utility.

13. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 20 to exclude the main_
access to a building on a scheduled land from being taken formal
possession of by the Land Administrator under a certificate of urgency.

14. _Clause 13 seeks to make an amendment to paragraph 23(a)_
in the same manner as is done in section 66 under clause 31 to
provide for the vesting of a parcel of a subdivided building in the
person or corporation on whose behalf the parcel has been acquired.

15. _Clauses 14 and 15 seek to amend sections 24 and 27 to delete_
all references to a "deed" or "deeds evidencing title" since the
registration of deeds system for Penang and Malacca is no longer
applicable.

16. _Clauses 16, 17 and 26 seek to amend subsection 29A(5) and_
sections 32 and 48 respectively to substitute for the word "interest"
the words "late payment charges" wherever appearing.

17. _Clause 18 seeks to introduce a new section 32A to provide_
for the meaning of "payment" for the purposes of sections 29A, 32
and 48.


-----

_Land Acquisition (Amendment)_ 31

18. _Clause 19 seeks to amend section 35 to provide that every_
withdrawal from acquisition shall be gazetted. It also introduces a
new subsection (5) to allow the Land Administrator to forfeit from
the deposit, where there is any withdrawal made under the section,
an amount which is sufficient to defray the amount of costs and
damages incurred by any person interested.

19. _Clause 20 seeks to amend subsection 37(2) to preclude an_
objection being made to the Court where the total amount of
compensation "awarded" does not exceed three thousand ringgit.
The current provision provides that no objection may be made if
the amount "claimed" does not exceed three thousand ringgit.

20. _Clause 21 seeks to amend subsection 38(5) to extend the time_
limit from three months to six months for the Land Administrator
to refer any objection to the Court.

21. _Clause 22 seeks to amend subsection 39(1) to increase the_
amount of deposit required by the Land Administrator in a reference
to the Court from a sum not exceeding one thousand five hundred
ringgit or the amount of the award, whichever is the less, to a sum
of three thousand ringgit or ten per cent of the amount claimed,
whichever is the less.

22. _Clause 23 seeks to introduce the new sections 40A, 40B, 40C_
and 40D.

The proposed section 40A provides for objection proceedings in
regard to compensation to be heard by a Court consisting of the
Judge and two assessors (one of whom shall be a valuation officer
employed by the Government). The assessors shall be appointed by
the Court from two lists, that is from the list of names of registered
valuers and appraisers to be submitted annually to the Court by the
President of the Board of Valuers, Appraisers and Estate Agents
and from the list of names of valuers employed by the Government
to be submitted annually to the Court by the Director General of
the Valuation and Property Services Department.

The proposed section 40B provides for the legal duty of the two
assessors to attend Court. An assessor who is not a valuation officer
employed by the Government will be paid a fee not exceeding five
hundred ringgit a day. If an assessor appointed from the list of
names submitted under subsection 40A(4) fails to attend Court without
written excuse by the Judge, the Court shall report the matter to
the President of the Board of Valuers, Appraisers and Estate Agents
for disciplinary proceedings to be taken against him. If an assessor
who is a valuation officer employed by the Government fails to
attend Court without written excuse by the Judge, the Court shall
report the matter to the Director General of the Valuation and Property
Services Department for disciplinary proceedings to the taken against
the assessor under the appropriate disciplinary regulations applicable
to such officer.


-----

32 _Bill_

The proposed section 40C provides that the opinion of each of
the two assessors on the various heads of compensation shall be
in writing and shall be recorded by the judge.

The proposed section 40D provides for the decision of the Court
on compensation matters to be based on the amount decided by the
two assessors. However, where the two assessors have each arrived
at a different decision from each other then the Judge shall elect
to concur with the decision of one of the assessors and the amount
of compensation to be awarded shall be the amount decided upon
by that assessor. Any decision made under this section is final and
there shall be no further appeal to a higher Court on the matter.

23. _Clause 24 seeks to amend section 45 by proposing to introduce_
a new subsection (1A) to provide for the provisions of the Third
Schedule to apply to every proceeding under the Act. The new
proposed subsection 45(1B) seeks to empower the Rules Committee
to amend the provisions of the Third Schedule. The procedure in
the Third Schedule is in fact the procedure being followed at present
by virtue of Practice Direction 11 of 1987.

24. _Clause 25 seeks to amend section 47 to provide that the decision_
of the Court shall also be signed by the two assessors in addition
to the existing requirement that it should be signed by the Judge.

25. _Clause 27 seeks to amend subsection 49(1) to substitute for_
the words "Supreme Court" the words "Court of Appeal and to the
Federal Court" in view of the introduction of the Court of Appeal
as an additional court for appeal. The amendment to the proviso
to subsection (1) is a consequential amendment necessitated by the
introduction of subsection 40D(3).

26. _Clause 28 seeks to amend section 54 by introducing a new_
paragraph (c) to allow the Land Administrator to publish a notice
under the Act in such local newspapers as he thinks fit.

27. _Clause 29 seeks to amend section 63 to include a "Commanding_
Officer" as a "Chief Police Officer" to enable the Land Administrator
to seek assistance from such person when taking possession of any
land.

28. _Clause 30 seeks to amend section 64 to insert a new paragraph_
_(a) and also to increase the penalty for obstruction from imprisonment_
for a term not exceeding one month or a fine not exceeding two
hundred ringgit or both to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
six months or a fine not exceeding five thousand ringgit or both.


-----

_Land Acquisition (Amendment)_ 33

29. _Clause 32, amongst other things, seeks to amend section 69_
to insert a new paragraph (d) to empower the Minister to make
rules to prescribe the form, fee or deposit regarding an acquisition
under paragraph 3(1)(b) or (c).

30. _Clause 33 seeks to amend the First Schedule._

Sub-subparagraph 1(1)(a) has been amended. The existing provision
stipulates that if a notification under section 4 in respect of any
scheduled land is followed within six months by a declaration under
section 8, the date for the purpose of valuing the market value of
the scheduled land is the date of the notification. The proposed
amendment seeks to increase that period to twelve months so that
it is consistent with the period specified in subsection 4(3),

A new subparagraph 1(1A) is proposed to be introduced to provide
that in assessing the value of any scheduled land, the valuer may
use any suitable method of valuation to arrive at the market value
but regard may be had to the prices paid for the recent sales of
land with similar characteristics situated within the same vicinity
and that particular consideration must be given to the last transaction
on the scheduled land within two years from the date with reference
to which the scheduled land is to be assessed under subparagraph
(1).

A new subparagraph 1(1 B) is proposed to be introduced to provide
that where only a part of the scheduled land is to be acquired, the
market value shall be determined by reference to the whole land
as shown in the document of title of the scheduled land and after
having regard to the particular features of that part.

A new subparagraph l(lC) is proposed to be introduced to permit
only the sales of land on or before the date of acquisition of any
scheduled land to be taken into consideration in determining the
market value of the acquired land. Any evidence of any sales
transactions effected after the date of notification shall not be
considered.

A new subparagraph 1(1D) is proposed to be introduced to provide
that in assessing the market value of any scheduled land to be
acquired which is held under a title for a period of years, regard
may be had to the date of expiry of the lease as shown in the
document of title, but regard may not be had to the likelihood of
a subsequent alienation to the person or body who is the proprietor
thereof immediately before the expiry of the lease.


-----

34 _Bill_

Subparagraph 1(2A) is amended to provide that where a Malay
reservation land, a Malay holding or customary land is to be acquired
("scheduled land"), the fact that it is such Malay reservation land,
Malay holding or customary land shall not be taken into account
in assessing the market value except where the scheduled land is
to be devoted after the acquisition solely to a purpose for the benefit
of persons who are eligible to hold such land under the relevant
written law.

Subparagraph l(2B) is proposed to be deleted as it is now considered
no longer necessary in view of the other amendments made to the
Act.

A new Subparagraph l(2BA) is proposed to be introduced to provide
that if the information submitted by the Slate Director of Town
and Country Planning or the Commissioner of the City of Kuala
Lumpur, as the case may be, indicates that the scheduled land is
within a local planning authority area, then the land shall be assessed
by having regard to the specific land use indicated for the land in
the development plan.

A new Subparagraph l(2D) is proposed to be introduced to provide
that in assessing the market value of any estate land, the market
value shall not be affected by the fact that it can be sold to one
person. This amendment is inserted in view of the decision made
by the Supreme Court in the case of Kumpulan Sua Belong Sdn.
_Bhd. V. Ezan Sdn. Ehd. & Anor [1993] 2 MLJ 289 where it was_
held that the Estate Land Board's approval is not required where
the estate land or only a portion of it is to be transferred to one
person.

A new Subparagraph 1(3A) is proposed to be introduced to provide
that the value of any building on any land to be acquired shall be
disregarded if that building is not permitted for that category of
land use, or by an express or implied condition or restriction, to
which the land is subject or deemed to be subject under the State
land law.

Subparagraph 2(b) of the First Schedule is amended to insert the
words ", which shall be deducted from the total compensation,"
to make it consistent with the provisions of paragraph 47(2) _(b) of_
the Act.

Subparagraph 2(d) of the First Schedule has also been amended
to delete the words "or his actual earnings" since these words are
unnecessary considering that the matter is already covered by the
existing Subparagraph 2 _(e)._


-----

_Land Acquisition (Amendment)_ 35

31. Clause 34 seeks to make consequential or necessary amendments
to the Second Schedule by amending Forms A, B, D, E, H, I, J,
K and L.

32. _Clause 35 seeks to amend the Act by proposing to introduce_
a new Third Schedule to provide for matters on evidence and procedure
in land reference cases.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure
the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.

[PN. (U[2]) 1883.]
