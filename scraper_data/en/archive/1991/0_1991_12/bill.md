EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Civil Aviation Act 1969 (hereinafter
referred to as "the Act").

2. Clause 1 provides for the short title and commencement.


-----

CIVIL AVIATION (AMENDMENT) 11

3. Clause 2 seeks to introduce new definitions of "airport", "Director
General" and "licensed company".

4. Clause 3 seeks to introduce a new Part 1A. The proposed section
2A contained in the new Part IA provides for the Director General of
Civil Aviation, Malaysia, to perform the duties and functions assigned
to him under this Act. With the privatisation of airport and aviation
services, it is to be expected that the Director General would have to
perform certain functions, in particular, the exercise of regulatory
functions in respect of the provision of airport and aviation services
including the establishment of standards and their enforcement. Thus
the proposed section 2B of the new Part IA sets out the duties and
functions of the Director General.

5. Clause 4 seeks to introduce two new paragraphs (dd) and (nn) to
section 3 (2). The new paragraph (dd) provides for the licensing,
inspection and regulation of aerodromes, for access to aerodromes
and places where aircrafts have landed and for prohibiting or
regulating the use of unlicensed aerodromes. The new paragraph (nn)
empowers the Minister to make regulations prescribing the charges
and fees for services provided in a designated airport and providing
for the recovery of such charges and fees.

6. Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new section 5 _A to empower the_
Minister to authorise any company under a licence to establish,
maintain and operate an aerodrome. At present such a power is only
implied in the Act.

7. Clause 9 seeks to delete section 18 which is redundant as the
interpretation of an "aerodrome" given in the Act would include a
Government aerodrome.

8. Clause 10 seeks to substitute Part VIIlA with a new Part VIIA
containing section 24A to section 24M.

The new section 24A empowers the Minister to grant a licence to a
company nominated by the Government of Malaysia to provide any
services in a designated airport. In granting the licence, the Minister
is required to set out the duration of the licence, the annual fee payable
by the licensed company, the particular duties of the licensed company
and such other terms and conditions as he thinks fit.

The new section 24B (1) seeks to empower the licensed company to
collect charges and fees prescribed by the Minister under regulations
made under section 3 (2) (n) and (nn).

The new section 24C provides that the licensed company may
submit to the Minister a memorandum containing proposals for any
change in the existing charges and fees prescribed under paragraphs
3 (2) (n) and (nn) and the procedures for such application and
approval.


-----

12 BILL

The new section 24D requires the Minister, where he approves the
memorandum under subsection 24c (3), to make regulations in respect
of the change in the existing charges and fees.

Section 24E seeks to spell out the general duties of the licensed
company.

Section 24F provides for the general penalty for any offence
committed by the licensed company under the Act or the regulations
made thereunder where no express penalty has been provided. The
punishment is a fine not exceeding fifty thousand ringgit or
imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both such fine and
imprisonment.

Section 24G seeks to provide for offences committed by a body
corporate including its director, secretary or manager.

Section 24H seeks to give the power of inspection to the Director
General of Civil Aviation to enable him to examine any of the
premises, building or facility of the licensed company.

Section 24I empowers the Minister to suspend or revoke the licence
issued to the licensed company upon the contravention of any of the
conditions of the licence. Subsection (3) of section 24i gives the
licensed company the opportunity to make representations with
respect to the proposed suspension or revocation and subsection (6)
provides for the decision of the Minister to be final and conclusive.

Section 24J, empowers the Minister to suspend or revoke the licence
issued to the licensed company upon the breach of any provision of the
Act or any regulations made thereunder, if the Minister is satisfied that
the breach or non-compliance was of a serious nature. Subsection (2)
of section 24J gives the licenced company the opportunity to make
representations with respect to the proposed suspension or revocation
and subsection (5) provides for the decision of the Minister to be final
and conclusive.

Section 24K gives special powers to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong in
any public emergency or in the interest of public safety to authorise
the Minister to suspend the licence of the licensed company and to
take temporary possession of any designated airport and provide any
airport and aviation services through the Department of Civil Aviation
or in any manner as the Minister thinks fit or to withdraw the use of
any airport from members of the public.

Section 24L relates to land in Malacca and Penang governed by
Article 166 (3) of the Constitution. It provides that the State Authority
may upon the request of the Minister and upon the application of the
licensed company either permit the occupation, use, control and
management by the licensed company of such land or alienate the land
to the company, on such terms and conditions as may be agreed


-----

CIVIL AVIATION (AMENDMENT) 13

between the Federal Government, the State Authority, and the
licensed company.

9. Clause 11 seeks to delete section 27A which arises from the
introduction of section 24K.

10. Other proposed amendments to the Act which have not been
specifically referred to are consequential or minor in nature.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1504.]
