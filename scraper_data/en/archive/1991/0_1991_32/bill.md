EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Legal Profession Act 1976 (hereinafter
referred to as "the Act").

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 3 of the Act by deleting the
definition of the three terms, namely, "Disciplinary Committee",
"Faculty" and "Inquiry Committee". It is a consequential
amendment.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 15 (3) by introducing the new
paragraphs (f) and (g). They provide that any application to the
Court for admission as an advocate and solicitor has to be supported
by documentary evidence that the applicant is a Federal citizen or
permanent resident of Malaysia and has passed or is exempted from
the Bahasa Malaysia Qualifying Examination. This amendment will
give statutory effect to what is the present practice.

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 67 (2) to provide that any
general meeting convened under section 65 (2) or (4) shall be
dissolved if there is no quorum within half an hour from the time
appointed for holding the meeting. Under the existing section
67 (2) the meeting has to be adjourned to the week next following
if there is no quorum. The amendment is now made to avoid the
inconvenience and expense of having to convene a second meeting
if there is no general support from the members.

5. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 68 to provide for the severance
of the present combined Selangor and Federal Territory Bar into the
Kuala Lumpur Bar and the Selangor State Bar. The State of Selangor
now has its own High Court at Shah Alam and, therefore, the
Selangor Bar is desirous of separating from the Federal Territory


-----

20 BILL

Bar. Section 71 allows the severance of a combined Bar but it is not
applicable to the Selangor and Federal Territory Bar because of the
provisions of section 68 (3).

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 70 by introducing a new
subsection (1A) to provide for the State Bar Committee to give an
annual report to members and to produce annual audited accounts.
This amendment is in line with the current practice. Clause 6 also
amends subsection (2) to provide that the Chairman of the State Bar
Committee shall preside at the annual general meeting. It further
provides for the adjournment of the meeting if there is no quorum.

7. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 70A (6) of the Act to provide
for any general meeting convened under subsection (3) or (5) of the
same section to be dissolved if there is no quorum. It makes
provision for the State Bar in the same way as provided for the
Malaysian Bar in clause 4.

8. Clause 8 seeks to amend section 71 by inserting a new
subsection (6) to provide for the apportionment of the assets of the
combined Bar in the event of a severance.

9. Clause 9 seeks to amend the Act by introducing a new section
78A to empower the Bar Council, with the approval of the Attorney
General, to make rules in order to implement the professional
indemnity insurance scheme against any class of professional
liability.

10. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 88A to provide for the_
suspension of an advocate and solicitor in the public interest in the
circumstances enumerated in the same section.

11. Clause 11 seeks to amend the Act by substituting sections 93
to 103 with the new sections 93 to 103G. The existing disciplinary
procedure for advocates and solicitors is impractical, causes much
delay and involves repetitive work at the various tiers of authority.
In practice it is impossible to keep within the time limits provided
by the Act. The amendments which clause 11 seeks to make will
simplify the disciplinary procedure and greatly reduce the time
involved in investigating an application or a complaint.

The more salient points on the proposed new sections are as
follows:

Section 93 provides for the establishment of a Disciplinary Board.

All matters relating to disciplinary proceedings are now
transferred from the Bar Council to a newly established body under
the Act to be known as the Disciplinary Board. The Disciplinary
Board shall be chaired by a person appointed by the Chief Justice.
