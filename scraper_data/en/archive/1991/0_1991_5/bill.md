55. The Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act 1966 and
the Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act 1973 are
repealed.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1952,
among other things to enable effect to be given to the International
Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea signed in London on
the 1st November 1974 ("the 1974 Safety Convention"). The 1974
Safety Convemion replaces and abrogates the International
Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea signed in London on the 17th
June 1960 ("the 1960 Safety Convention") which was given effect to
by Malaysia through the Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act 1966
(Act 15 of 1966).

2. Most of the provisions of the 1974Safety Convention, which has
developed from the previous Safety Conventions, particularly those
of 1960 and 1948, are already capable of being given effect to through
the provisions of the Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act 1966,
which gives effect to the 1960 Safety Convention, and also through
those proyisions of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1952 which
give effect to the previous Convemion, that is the 1948 Safety
Convention. That being so, the provisions needed in this Bill to amend
the Ordinance to give effect to the 1974 Safety Convention are few and
are, together with other amendments related to the 1974 Safety
Convention, as follows:

_(a) Clause 2(g). This clause seeks to substitute the existing_
definition in section 2 of "Safety Convention", which refers
to the 1948 Safety Convention, with one which refers to the
1974 Safety Convention.

_(b) Clause 21. This clause seeks to amend section 256A(1)_
which empowers the Minister to make construction rules
prescribing requirements for the bull, equipments and


Repeal of

and

machinery of passenger steamers. The Minister is required
to include in such rules requirements which implement the
provisions of the Safety Convention prescribing such
requirements. The amendment will enable and require rules
to be made to implement the requirements of the 1974
Safety Convention as to the fuel used in passenger steamers.
A corresponding provision appears in the new section 256B,
as mentioned in paragraph 3(a)(i) below,

_(c) Clause 36. This clause seeks to substitute section 293,_
which adopts rules made under the Merchant Shipping Acts
of the United Kingdom with respect to the carriage of
dangerous goods, The new section empowers the Minister
to make rules for regulating the carriage of dangerous goods
in ships. Under the new section, rules may be made to
implement the relevant provisions of the 1974 Safety
Convention.

_(d) Clause 37. This clause seeks to amend section 297, which_
concerns the precautions to be taken to prevent grain cargo
laden in ships from shifting.

(i) Subsection (1) makes it an offence for any ship laden
with grain cargo to proceed from or arrive at any port
or place in the Federation unless precautions have
been taken to prevent the grain cargo from shifting. It
is proposed (under paragraph (b)) to amend that
subsection so as also to make it an offence for a
Malaysian ship so laden to proceed from or arrive at
any port or place in any country unless such
precautions have been taken.

(ii) Under paragraph (c), the penalty in subsection (2) is
increased.

(iii) Subsection (3) requires compliance with regulations
made by the Minister prescribing the precautions to be
taken to prevent grain cargo from shifting, but such
compliance is not necessary if the ship is loaded in
accordance with regulations approved by the
appropriate United Kingdom authority or is
constructed and loaded in accordance with any plan
approved by him. It is proposed (under paragraph (d))
to amend that subsection so as to end the dependence
on the United Kingdom regulations and plan and to
have instead dependence on provisions approved by
the Minister as respects the loading in question other
than regulations made under that subsection.

(iv) It is proposed (under paragraph (e)) to substitute the
definition of "grain" in subsection (6) with one
which accords with the definition in the 1974 Safety
Convention.


-----

MERCHANT SHIPPING (AMENDMENT) 49

_(e) Clause 38. This clause seeks to introduce a new section_
299A which empowers the Minister to make regulations
with respect to ships provided with nuclear power plants for
the purpose of enabling effect to be given to the relevant
provisions of the 1974 Safety Convention.

_(f) Clause 39. This clause seeks to introduce a new section_
299B which empowers the Minister to make regulations to
provide that any country to which the 1960 Safety
Convention applied shall be treated for the purposes of the
Ordinance as if it were a country to which the 1974 Safety
Convention applies and that any certificate recognised as a
Safety Convention certificate under the 1960 Safety
Convention may be treated as a Safety Convention
certificate under the 1974 Safety Convention.

_(g) Clause 41. At present the definition of "country to which the_
Safety Convention applies" in section 2 refers to countries
and territories declared by the United Kingdom. Clause 41
seeks to introduce a new section 306A which empowers the
Minister to declare such countries and territories. In
consequence the said definition in section 2 is amended by
_clause 2(c) so that the definition will refer to a country or_
territory declared by the Minister under the new section
306A.

3. The Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act 1966, which purports
to amend the Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1952, among other things
to give effect to the 1960 Safety Convention, contains provisions
which do not textually form part of the Ordinance. Certain clauses in
this Bill seek to re-enact those provisions into the Ordinance, with
necessary changes and modification, so that, as has been the case in
connection with other, amendments before and after the 1966 Act, the
merchant shipping law as amended from time to time will continue, as
long as it is convenient, to be contained in a single text. The clauses
in question are as follows:

_(a) Clause 22. This clause seeks to introduce a new section_
256B which re-enacts sections 3 and 8 of the 1966 Act.
Section 3 of that Act empowers the Minister to make cargo
ship construction and survey rules relating to ships to which
that section applies, which are defined in subsection (3) of
section 3 (now subsection (4) of the new section 256B) as
sea-going ships of not less than 500 tons gross tonnage or
such lower tonnage as the Minister may specify, other than
passenger steamers, troop ships, pleasure yachts, fishing
vessels and ships not propelled by mechanical means.
Section 8 of the 1966 Act provides the penalty for
contravening the rules and provides for power to inspect


-----

50 BILL

any ship for the purpose of seeing that she complies with the
rules. Those sections are re-enacted in the new section 256s
with the following changes:

(i) The power to make cargo ship construction and
survey rules now includes the power to make rules to
prescribe the requirements for the fuel used in ships
to which the section applies. This change
corresponds to the change made in relation to the
power to make construction rules for passenger ships
in section 256A (mentioned in paragraph 2(b) above).
(ii) Subsection (3) of the new section 256B is a new
provision which enables the cargo ship construction
and survey rules to provide for surveys to be
undertaken by persons appointed by certain
organisations, to make modifications to certain
provisions of the Ordinance in their application to
surveys undertaken by such persons, to prescribe
survey fees and to provide for the fees to be payable,
in the case of surveys carried out by such persons, to
them.
(iii) Subsection (5) of the new section 256B is a new
provision which provides that the definition of
"declaration of survey" in section 2, which intends a
declaration by a Surveyor of Ships (who is a public
officer), shall not apply in relation to surveys carried
out otherwise than by a Surveyor of Ships.
(iv) The penalty for contravening the rules is increased
from the fine of $5,000.00, as presently provided in
section 8(1) of the 1966 Act, to $10,000.00, as in
subsection (6) of the new section 256B.

_(b) Clause 23. This clause seeks to introduce a new section_
268A which re-enacts section 4 of the 1966 Act, which
provides for the issuance of safety construction certificates
" and exemption certificates in respect of ships to which
section 3 of that Act (now the new section 256B) applies.
However, subsections (4) and (7) of section 4, which relate
to extension of the maximum five-year period for
certificates to a maximum of six years, have not been
carried into the new section 268A as such extension is
contrary to the 1974 Safety Convention.

_(c) Clause 25. This clause seeks to introduce a new section_
269A which re-enacts section 5 of the 1966 Act. That section
has the effect of extending, with certain modifications, the
scope of section 269 of the Ordinance, which requires that
notice be given of certain alterations made in a passenger
steamer, to any ship in respect of which any certificate
under section 4 of the 1966 Act (now the new section 268A)
is in force.


-----

MERCHANT SHIPPING (AMENDMENT) 51

_(d) Clause 26. This clause seeks to introduce a new section_
270A which re-enacts section 6of the 1966 Act. That section
prohibits a ship to which section 3 of the 1966 Act (now the
new section 256 B) applies from proceeding to sea unless
there is in force in respect of the ship the appropriate
certificates. That section is re-enacted with the following
changes;
(i) The penalty for contravening the prohibition is
increased from a fine of $1,000.00, as presently
provided in section 6(2) of the 1966 Act, to
$10,000.00, as in subsection (2) of the new section
270A.
(ii) Under subsection (3) of the new section 270A, the
appropriate certificates required to be produced in
order to obtain clearance for a ship are to be produced
to the Port Officer instead of, as in subsection (3) of
section 6 of the 1966 Act, to the officer of customs.

_(e) Clause 28. This clause seeks to introduce a new section_
274A which re-enacts section? of the 1966 Act. That section
exempts from the cargo ship construction and survey rules
ships not registered in Malaysia which have accepted Safety
Convention certificates equivalent to the certificates
mentioned in section 4 of that Act (now the new section
268A).

4. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 10 of the Ordinance by inserting
a new subsection (2A) which empowers the Minister to appoint, for
special purposes and on special occasions, any person, whether or not
acitizen of Malaysia, to perform any specific functions of a Surveyor
of Ships or a Radio Surveyor under the Ordinance at any place,
whether within or outside Malaysia. Another amendment is to
expressly restrict to public off icers the delegation of the powers of the
Surveyor-General of Ships.

5. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 18 of the Ordinance to provide
that before a Malaysian ship is registered, its name shall be marked in
Roman capital letters on the ship. This amendment would prevent the
use of any script other than Roman capital letters for this purpose,
except where the approval of the Registrar General has been obtained.
The amendment also gives the power to the Registrar General to
approve proposed names for ships intending to be registered.

6. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 69 of the Ordinance so as, inter
_alia, to restrict the application of Part III of the Ordinance to Malaysian_
ships and to widen the scope of the application of that Part to such
ships.

7. Sections 71 to 87 of the Ordinance deal with the question of the
officers to be provided for different classes of ships and the certificates


-----

52 BILL

such officers are required to hold, and with matters related to such
certificates. Clause 6 seeks to delete those sections and clause 7 seeks
to introduce a new section 71 which empowers the Minister to make
rules concerning the qualifications of officers and seamen of ships and
the manning requirements for ships, so that the matters dealt with by
the repealed sections will instead be provided for by the rules. This
change is to facilitate the giving effect to and compliance with the
Convention on Standards of Training, Certificates and Watchkeeping
for Seafarers 1978, which Malaysia is preparing to accede to. To wards
that end, it is also necessary to reclassify and redefine the voyage
Jimits for ships, and the related classes of ships. This is done in clause
_2(e) and (/), which has the effect of substituting "local-trade voyage"_
and "home-trade voyage" with "near-coastal trade voyage", "localtrade ship" and "home-trade ship" with "near-coastal trade ship", and
"local-trade passenger steamer" and "home-trade passenger steamer"
with "near-coastal trade passenger steamer", and in clause 2(d),
which amends the definition of "foreign-going ship" accordingly,
_Clauses 8 to 14, and clauses 16,19,26,32 and 48, make consequential_
amendments to other sections.

8. Clause 15 seeks to delete subsection (6) of section 208 of the
Ordinance which exempts from the Ordinance the conveyance of
Asian passengers from China to the Pederation in a ship authorised to
make the voyage in accordance with a certificate issued under the
Chinese Passengers Act 1855 of the United Kingdom. That subsection
is no longer necessary.

9. Under subsection (1) of section 236 of the Ordinance, an offence
is committed if a passenger steamer plying at or carrying passengers
to or from any port in the Federation has on board a number of
passengers which is greater than the number allowed for the steamer.
_Clause 17 seeks to amend that subsection so that an offence will also_
be committed if there has been received on board of any passenger
steamer such number of passengers. The penalty for the offence is
increased.

10. Clause 18 seeks to amend section 244 of the Ordinance to
empower the Minister to make rules to prescribe the fees to be paid in
respect of the embarkation or discharge of passengers. The penalty
which the Minister may direct for breach of the rules is increased.

11. _Clause 24 seeks to amend section 269 of the Ordinance which_
requires the owner or master of a certificated passenger steamer to
give notice of alterations to the ship and its equipment. The amendment
is to transfer to the Surveyor-General of Ships the power of the
Minister under subsection (4) to require a ship to be surveyed again,
and also to increase the penalty for failure to comply with the
requirements of the section as to the giving of notice of alterations.

12. Clause 27 seeks to amend section 271 of the Ordinance. The
amendment of subsection (6) under paragraph (c) is to expressly


-----

MERCHANT SHIPPING (AMENDMENT) 53

provide that a person to be authorised to sign a certificate in respect
of a ship on behalf of the Surveyor-General of Ships must be a public
officer. The new subsection (10) under paragraph (e) empowers the
Minister to make rules to prescribe the fees in respect of certificates
and extensions thereof under Part V of the Ordinance,

13. Clause 32 seeks to amend section 289 of the Ordinance which
lays down certain conditions for the carriage of dangerous goods.
Under paragraph (b), the penalty for failure to comply with that
section is increased and under paragraph (c) the definition of
"dangerous goods" in subsection (3) of section 289 is substituted with
a wider definition.

14. Subsection (1) of section 305 of the Ordinance applies the
provisions of Part V of the Ordinance with respect to the detention of
ships to foreign ships which are unsafe whilst within any port in the
Federation. Subsection (2) excludes from the application of that
section any foreign ship not bound for a port of the Federation which
comes into any port of the Federation for any purpose other than the
purpose of embarking or landing passengers or taking in or discharging
cargo or taking in bunkers. Clause 40 seeks to delete the said
subsection (2) so that all foreign ships which are unsafe will be subject
to detention whilst within any port in the Federation.

15. Clause 42 seeks to introduce a new Part VA relating to pollution
from ships, comprising sections 306B to 306K, which deal with the
problem of the escape of oil and harmful substances from ships. The
provisions give wide po wers to the Director of Marine to take effective
action to prevent or reduce the extent of pollution through the escape
of oil or any harmful substance. He may under section 306o issue a
notice to the owner of a ship requiring that certain action be taken or
prohibiting the removal of the ship or its cargo. He may also under
section 306o take any necessary action to prevent or reduce the extent
of the pollution if action under section 306D has not been effective,
and the expenses entailed by such action will be recoverable from the
owner of the ship. Section 306i gives extensive powers to the Director
of Marine in the event of a maritime casualty, to prevent, reduce or
eliminate pollution from the escape of oil or harmful substances,
including the power to direct the sinking or destruction of a ship.
Section 306K gives the Minister the power to make rules covering a
wide range of matters connected with the carriage or storage of oil or
hannful substances on ships.

16. Clause 43 seeks to amend section 309 of the Ordinance so as to
empower the Minister, when making load Hne rules under that section,
to provide for surveys or inspections under the rules to be undertaken
by persons appointed by specified organisations, to prescribe fees in
respect of surveys and inspections under the rules and, where surveys
and inspections are carried out by persons appointed by a specified
organisation, to provide for fees to be payable to those persons or
organisations.

54 BILL

17. Section 315 of the Ordinance provides for the issuance, after
compliance with survey and other requirements, of load line
certificates in respect of load line ships registered in the Federation on
payment of the fee prescribed by the Minister. According to subsection
(2), the certificates are to be issued by the Surveyor-General of Ships
or a person authorised by him. Where a certificate is issued by the
Surveyor-General of Ships, it may under subsection (3) be signed on
his behalf by any person authorised by him. Clause 44 seeks to amend
section 315 in order to empower the Minister, when prescribing fees,
to provide for the fees to be payable to a person authorised pursuant
to subsection (2) in relation to certificates issued by him, and also to
expressly provide that the person to be authorised under subsection (3)
to sign certificates on behalf of the Surveyor-General of Ships must be
a public officer.

18. At present the definition of "country to which the Load Line
Convention applies" in section 2 refers to countries and territories
declared by the United Kingdom. Clause 45 seeks to introduce a new
section 33 IA which empowers the Minister to declare such countries
and territories. In consequence the said definition in section 2 is
amended by clause 2(b) so that the definition will refer to a country or
territory declared by the Minister under section 33lA.

19. Section 332 of the Ordinance lays down the circumstances in
which, for the purpose of enquiries and investigations under Part VII
of the Ordinance, a shipping casualty shall be deemed to occur.
Generally speaking, under that section a shipping casualty must be an
occurrence in which a British or Malaysian ship is involved, so that
even where the casualty occurs on or near the coasts of the Federation,
it is not deemed a shipping casualty if it involves other than a British
or Malaysian ship. Clause 46 seeks to substitute that section with a
broader provision. The new section differs from the existing section
mainly in its application to any ship where the casualty occurs on or
near the coasts of the Federation.

20. The proviso to subsection (1) of section 335 of the Ordinance
prohibits the appointment of a Court of Investigation for the purpose
of holding a formal investigation into any shipping casualty occurring
to a ship not registered in the Federation, except in the circumstances
mentioned in that proviso. One of the circumstances is that the
appointment of the Court is requested or consented to by the
Government of that part of the British dominions in which the ship is
registered. Clause 48 seeks to amend that proviso so that the exception
based on request or consent can apply to any country.

21. _Clause 49 seeks to replace Part IX of the Ordinance with a new_
Part IX. Under the provisions of the existing Part IX, which is based
on the 1924 Convention relating to the limitation of liability of
shipowners, a ship owner can limit his liability in certain cases of loss
of life, injury or damage if such liability exceeds the amounts


-----

MERCHANT SHIPPING (AMENDMENT) 55

prescribed in that Part. Those amounts are no longer appropriate. The
proposed new Part IX, which is based on the 1957 Convention,
prescribes higher amounts. The amendments proposed will also assist
in bringing about uniformity in the law relating to the limitation of
liability of shipowners as the new Part IX is almost identical to the law
relating to the limitation of liability of shipowners in force in Sabah
and Sarawak.

22. Clause 50 seeks to substitute section 381. Subsection (1) of the
existing section 381 empowers the receiver of wrecks, among other
things, to take possession of, remove, seil or destroy a wreck in certain
circumstances. Under the new section 381 he is additionally
empowered to take all necessary measures to prevent pollution from
the ship and he is permitted, as an alternative to his taking action
himself under section 381, to consent to the owner or master of the
ship taking action and to require security to ensure the performance of
all actions which the owner or master has agreed to undertake.
Subsection (2) of the existing section 381 lays down the requirement
of at least seven clear days' notice of an intended sale and subsection
(3) provides that the owner of any property to be sold is entitled,
before it is sold, to have the property delivered to him on payment of
the fair market value thereof. These provisions have been omitted
from the new section 381,

23. Clause 51 seeks to amend section 445 by inserting in subsection
(1) two new paragraphs which will enable port rules to be made to
ensure the provision of facilities for the reception of oily residues and
mixtures, residues and mixtures containing harmful substances or
noxious liquid substances, sewage and garbage, and to require vessels
to discharge those substances for disposal to reception facilities
before entering or leaving port. The penalty for breach of port rules is
increased.

24. Clause 52 seeks to amend section 477 of the Ordinance. Under
the existing section 477(1), all boat licences expire on the 31st of
December of the year in which they were issued, With the amendment
licences issued need not all expire at the end of the calendar year but
may be valid for such period of time not exceeding twelve months
from the date of issue. Under paragraph (b) the penalty for failure to
report any change of owner and of master is increased.

25. Clause 53 seeks to amend section 492 of the Ordinance to enable
the Magistrate's Court to try any offence under the Ordinance.

26. Clause 54 seeks to increase the penalties under various sections
of the Ordinance. Where it is necessary to increase the penalty under
any other section which is amended in some other respect, the
amendment as to penalty is made under the respective clause.


-----

56 BILL

27. _Clause 55 is a repeal clause. The Merchant Shipping_
(Amendment) Act 1973, which has not come into force, is to be
repealed as subsequent developments have rendered the amendments
made by it no longer necessary.

28. The other amendments which are not specifically mentioned in
this Explanatory Statement are either minor or consequential
amendments.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1236.]
