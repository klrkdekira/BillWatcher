Amendment of

-----

14 BILL

4. Clause 4 introduces new sections 28A, 28B, 28c, 28D, 28E, 28F and
28G into the principal Act.

_Section 28A_

_5. The new section 28A provides that where an insurer gives_
information to the Director General under section 28 or where the
Director General is satisfied either after an inspection under section
18, or after an investigation under section 27, or otherwise, that the
insurer is carrying on its business in a manner detrimental to the
interests of its policy owners or its creditors or the public generally,
or that it is insolvent, or has become or is likely to become unable to
meet all or any of its obligations, or is about to suspend payment to any
extent, or has contravened any provision of the principal Act, or any
condition of its registration, or any provision of any written law, the
Director General can by order in writing exercise any one or more of
his powers under subsection (1) of the new section 28A. Under these
powers the Director General can require the insurer to do or not to do
any act, in relation to the insurer or its business or its directors or
employees. The Director General can prohibit the insurer from issuing
any new policies relating to all insurance business, or any class or any
type or description, of insurance business, or extending any credit
facility or transacting other business or carrying on other activities for
a period set out in the order. The Director General can also appoint
any person as an employee or director of the insurer, and also remove
from office any employee or director of the insurer. The Director
General can also appoint a person to advise the insurer for the proper
conduct of its business and require the insurer to pay such person a
remuneration as may be set out in the Director General's order. The
Director General is also empowered to terminate any contract,
agreement or arrangement entered into by the insurer with any person
for such person to provide the insurer with consultancy or management
services of any description. These powers of the Director General are
exercisable only with the prior approval of the Minister, except in the
case of an order requiring the insurer to take steps or action in relation
to the insurer, or its business, or its employees or directors.

Subsection (2) provides that the Director General may recommend
to the Minister to make an order published in the Gazette for the
Director General to assume control of the whole or any part of the
property, business and affairs of the insurer, and either carry on the
insurer's business and affairs himself, or appoint any person to do so
on his behalf. Whether or not such an order for assumption of control
has been made, the Minister's order may authorise the Director
General to make an application to the High Court to appoint a receiver
or manager to manage the whole or part of the business, affairs and
property of the insurer. The Minister's order can also authorise the
Director General to present a petition to the High Court for the
winding up of the insurer.


-----

INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) 15

Subsection (3) provides that the orders mentioned above, whether
of the Director General, or of the Minister, can, from time to time, be
amended, varied or replaced.

Subsection (4) requires that any such order shall not be made
without giving the insurer, and also any director or employee of the
insurer who is to be removed from office, or any person in respect of
whom a consultancy or management contract is to be terminated, a
reasonable opportunity of making representations in respect of the
proposed order. However, where delay in making an order would be
detrimental to the interests of the insurer, or its policy owners or
creditors, or the public generally, the order may be made first and the
opportunity to make representations given immediately after the order
has been made. In such case, the order may, in consequence of such
representations, be confirmed, amended, varied, replaced or revoked,
subject to such conditions, which the authority concerned thinks fit.

Any order as mentioned above may at any time be revoked by an
order by the authority which made the original order.

_Section 28E_
6. The new section 28B makes provision with regard to the period of
appointment, terms, conditions and remuneration of persons
appointed by the Director General under an order made under section
28A.

A person holding an appointment made by the Director General
under section 28A is conferred by subsection (4) with immunity from
any obligation or liability by reason only of holding such appointment.

A receiver or manager appointed by the High Court under section
28A is to have all its proper costs, charges, and expenses, including its
remuneration, payable out of the assets of the insurer in priority to all
other claims.

_Section 28c_

_1. The new section 28c requires any employee or director removed_
from office or a person whose consultancy or management contract
has been terminated under section 28A to cease to hold the office from
which he is removed or provide the consultancy or management
services with effect from the date set out in the order providing for his
removal or the termination of the consultancy or management
contract. He is not, thereafter, to hold any office in, or provide any
services whatsoever to, that insurer or be in any way concerned with
or take part in any activity of that insurer.

The removal of an employee or director, or the termination of a
consultancy or management contract, mentioned above is rendered
lawful and valid notwithstanding anything contained in any contract
of service or contract for services or other contract or agreement, and
the person so removed is not entitled to claim any compensation for
the loss or termination of office or the termination of the consultancy
or management contract.


-----

16 BILL

_Section 28D_

8. The new section 28D makes provision for giving effect to an order
under section 28A whereby control of an insurer has been assumed by
the Director General or by a person appointed by the Director General.
It places an obligation on the directors and employees to submit the
insurer's property, business and affairs to such control and provide
any facilities that may be required to carry on its business and affairs.
Throughout the period of control the powers of the insurer and of its
directors are to be vested in the Director General or in the person
appointed by the Director General to assume control, as the case may
be. During the period of the order under which the control is assumed,
the directors of the insurer are prohibited from engaging in any
activity in relation to the insurer, either directly or indirectly, except
where they are required or authorised by the Director General, or by
the person appointed to assume control, as the case may be, and during
such period no remuneration of whatever nature shall accrue or be
payable to any director, except as may be approved in writing by the
Director General, or the person appointed as aforesaid, in relation to
any activity required or authorised as aforesaid by the Director
General or by the person so appointed, as the case may be.

_Section 28E_

9. The new section 28E provides that where the Director General or
a person appointed by the Director General has assumed control of an
insurer pursuant to an order under section 28A, the Director General
or such person may apply to the High Court for an order to reduce the
share capital of the insurer by cancelling any portion of its paid-up
capital which is lost or unrepresented by available assets. In such case
the High Court can also make an order for the shares of the insurer for
which payment has not been made to be cancelled where on the expiry
of thirty days from the date of any call by the insurer on its members
