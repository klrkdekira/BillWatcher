Malaysian Optical Council. Members of the Council will include
ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians representing the
public and private sectors. The Director General of Health will be

optometrists. Clause 16 seeks to appoint the Director General to
be the Registrar and clause 17 seeks to provide for the two separate
Registers for opticians and optometrists, respectively. Clauses 18
and 19 and the Schedules set out the qualifications in respect of
which the holders can be registered as opticians or optometrists.
Provisions are made in respect of persons who have been practising
as opticians prior to the coming into force of the proposed Act. If
a person has been practising as an optician for one year or more
before the date of coming into force of the Act, he may be
registered as an optician. Persons who hold qualifications listed
in the Schedules or who hold qualifications not listed in the
Schedules but are deemed suitable for registration may also be
registered under the proposed Act. Clause 20 seeks to provide for
the mode of registration. Clause 21 seeks to set out the Council's
disciplinary jurisdiction. Clause 22 seeks to set out the disciplinary
punishments which the Council can impose. Clause 23 seeks to
provide for an inquiry to be held by the Council before making a
disciplinary order. Clause 24 seeks to require a person whose name
has been removed from the Register to surrender his certificate of
registration. Clause 25 seeks to provide for an opportunity to appeal
against the Council's decision. Clause 26 seeks to provide for the
power of the Council to remove from the Register the names of
persons who have become incapable of performing the duties of an
optician or optometrist because of physical or mental infirmity.
_Clause 27 seeks to empower the Council to remove the names of_
certain other persons from the Register. Clause 28 seeks to allow


-----

28 BILL

a registered person whose name has been removed from the
Register to apply for the restoration of his name in the Register if
he satisfies the Council that by reason of a change in circumstances
since the date of the removal of his name it is just that his name

be restored. It also provides for appeals to the Minister.

5. _Part IV of the Bill deals with the practice of optometry. Clause_

_29 seeks to allow only registered persons to practise as opticians_
or optometrists. Clause 30 enables the Council to permit certain
opticians to prescribe and dispense contact lenses although
generally the Bill does not allow opticians to do so. Clause 31
seeks to prohibit the use of drugs to measure the powers of vision.
_Clause 32 deals with the annual practising certificate and clause_

_33 seeks to make it an offence for a registered person to practise_
without a valid annual practising certificate.

6. Part V of the Bill contains general provisions. Clause 34 deals
with fraudulent registration. Clause 35 deals with offences
generally. Clause 36 seeks to place certain restrictions on the sale
of optical appliances. Clause 37 seeks to provide for the penalties
which can be imposed on a person convicted of an offence under
the Bill. Clause 38 seeks to allow public officers authorised by the
Director General to inspect premises used by persons practising
optometry. It also seeks to allow such public officers to seize
documents, apparatus and articles. Clause 39 seeks to allow public
officers authorised by the Director General to conduct prosecutions
under the Bill. Clause 40 seeks to make the director or manager
of a body corporate or the partner of a firm also guilty of an offence
committed by the body corporate or firm unless it is proved that
the offence is committed without his knowledge. Clause 41 seeks
to allow the Minister after consulting the Council to amend the
Schedules. Clause 42 seeks to allow the Minister, after consulting
the Council, to make regulations.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure
the amount of which cannot at present be ascertained.
