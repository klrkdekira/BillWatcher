EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to regulate the establishment of a securities depository
which will be responsible for operating a system that will enable
securities transactions to be effected without the need for physical
delivery of scrips. The cornerstone of the system is the transfer of
ownership of a security through a computerised book entry rather than
by physical delivery and execution of instruments of transfer. The
establishment of a depository will create a more efficient settlement
system in respect of dealings in securities on the stock market and
will also eliminate financial loss due to misplacement, forgery or loss of
scrips.

PART I
2. Part I seeks to provide for preliminary matters.

3. Clause 1 provides for the coming into force of this Bill.

4. Clause 2(1) defines certain words and expressions used in the Bill.
Some of the salient definitions are explained below.

The word "central depository" is defined to mean a company which is
approved by the Minister under the proposed Act to establish and operate
a system for the central handling of securities deposited with it. Dealings
in such securities are effected by means of entries in securities accounts
without the physical delivery of scrips.

The expression "authorised depository agent" is defined to mean a
person appointed by a central depository under clause 13 of the Bill to be
its agent.

The expression "deposited security" is defined to mean a security
standing to the credit of a securities account and would include a security
in the securities account that is in suspense.

The word "depositor" is defined to mean a holder of a securities
account.

The word "issuer", in relation to a deposited security, is defined to mean
the public company, corporation, government, or the body, corporate or
unincorporate, which issued the security and includes any person
performing the functions of a registrar for such issuer or an issuing house
in respect of that security.


Reference

of a public
company in

Act 1965.

48 BILL

The word "scrip" is defined to mean a document that is a security or a
document that is a document of title to a security.

The expression "stock exchange" is defined to mean the stock exchange
established under the Securities Industry Act 1983.

5. Subclauses (2) and (3) of clause 2 seeks to clarify certain references
made in the proposed Act. Subclause (3) seeks to clarify that a reference
to a security being deposited, or required to be deposited, with a central
depository is to be construed as a reference to a deposit of, or a requirement
for the deposit of, the scrip, the instruments of transfer, or any other
documents representing such security, with the central depository.

PART II

6. Part II relates to the establishment of a central depository.

7. _Clause 3 prohibits a person from establishing and maintaining or_
holding himself out as maintaining a central depository unless an approval
in writing has been given by the Minister. Contravention of this provision
constitutes an offence.

8. Clause 4 sets out the manner in which an application for the
establishment and maintenance of a central depository is to be made and
_subclause (2) specifies the documents and information which has to be_
submitted to the Minister.

9. _Clause 5 sets out the matters in respect of which the Minister must_
satisfy himself before approving an application for establishing a central
depository. It also sets out conditions which may be imposed by the
Minister on giving the approval.

10. Clause 6 empowers the Minister to establish an advisory committee
and sets out its functions and composition,

11. Clause 7 provides that the Minister shall be notified of any amendment
to the rules of a central depository and empowers him, after consultation
with the central depository, to amend the rules of the central depository.

12. Clause 8 makes it the duty of a central depository to take all
necessary steps to ensure orderly dealings in securities deposited with it.

13. Clause 9 provides that any person who is an authorised depository
agent, an issuer, a depositor, or a user shall comply with the rules of a
central depository.

14. Clause 10 makes provision for a central depository to provide
assistance to the Registrar in relation to the performance of his functions
and duties.

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (CENTRAL DEPOSITORIES) 49

PART III

15. Part III is divided into four divisions and deals with the deposit and
withdrawal of securities, securities accounts and records, securities
transactions and entries in respect of such transactions.

16. Division I relates to the deposit of securities with a central depository.
_Clause 11 defines certain expressions used in this Part. The expression_
"jumbo certificate" in relation to a deposited security is defined to mean
a certificate comprising not less than fifty thousand units of securities of
an issuer which is registered in the name of the central depository or its
nominee company. The expression "notification date" is defined to mean
the date on which the notice pursuant to clause 14 is given by a stock
exchange. The expression "prescribed date" in relation to any prescribed
security is defined to mean the date specified in the notice given by a stock
exchange under clause 14 as the last day on which prescribed security may
be traded on a stock market unless such security has been deposited with
the central depository. The expression "prescribed security" is defined to
mean a security which has been prescribed by a stock exchange to be
deposited with a central depository under clause 14.

17. Clause 12 sets out the duties of a central depository.

18. Clause 13 authorises a central depository to appoint persons to be its
authorised depository agents. It sets out the persons who may be appointed
authorised depository agents and authorises them, when required by the
central depository or the Registrar, in respect of the purposes carried out
by such authorised depository agent, to give, divulge, reveal or disclose to
the central depository or the Registrar any information or document
relating to a securities account. It also makes it an offence for any person
to act as, or hold himself out to be, an authorised depository agent unless
he has been so appointed in writing by a central depository.

19. _Clause 14 empowers a stock exchange, after consultation with a_
central depository, to prescribe any security, listed or proposed to be listed
for quotation on its official list, to be deposited with the central depository.
It also requires the stock exchange to notify the public of all the securities
prescribed by it to be deposited with the central depository.

20. Clause 15 deals with trading in prescribed securities during the
period between the notification date and the prescribed date. During this
period any scrip delivered by a seller to an authorised depository agent to
settle a sale made by him is required to be sent to the issuer together with
the instrument of transfer for the purpose of registering the security
underlying the scrip in the name of the central depository. The buyer of the
prescribed security must have a securities account when purchasing such
security. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that all prescribed
securities traded after the notification date will be kept in custody by the
central depository.


-----

50 BILL

21. Clause 16 empowers the central depository to prescribe a date
following which no member company may receive a scrip representing a
prescribed security merely for safe custody.

22. _Clause 17 provides that a prescribed security may not after the_
prescribed date be traded on a stock market unless such security has been
deposited with a central depository. However, such security may, at any
time after the prescribed date, be deposited with the central depository but
in such a case it cannot be utilised to settle a transaction which took place
on a stock market prior to the date of deposit of that security.

23. _Clause 18 deals with the verification of scrips and the transfer of_
deposited securities in the name of a central depository or its nominee
company. A central depository and its authorised depository agent is
required to lodge with the issuer all scrips and instruments of transfer or
other documents representing prescribed securities which have been
deposited with them. On receipt of such scrip or document, the issuer is
required to do all such acts and things as may be necessary to register the
transfer of the securities in the name of the central depository or its
nominee company. Subclause (3) sets out the circumstances when the
issuer shall refuse to register a transfer. In the absence of the aforesaid
circumstances and any other circumstances which the issuer is for any
reason entitled to refuse to register a transfer, it must complete and deliver
to the central depository the appropriate certificate within seven market
days after the transfer is lodged. Where the issuer refuses to register a
transfer, it shall serve on the transferor a written notice giving the reasons
for such refusal. The clause also provides that an instrument of transfer
shall be capable of registration in the name of a central depository or its
nominee company even if such instrument is not executed by the depository
ornominee company, provided that the instrument has been duly certificated
in the manner provided in subclause (7).

24. Clause 19 provides that a central depository and its authorised
depository agent shall not, except in the case of any wilful act, omission,
neglect or default on their part, be liable for any loss, damage or liability
suffered or incurred by any person in respect of any dealing in a deposited
security which transfer has been refused under clause 18.

25. Clause 20 provides for the issuance of jumbo certificates by an
issuer.

26. Clause 21 seeks to make it clear that a central depository and its
nominee company is a bare trustee in relation to any deposited securities
which are registered in their respective names for the purposes of paragraph
_6\(9)(a) of the Companies Act 1965._

27. Division II relates to withdrawal of securities. Clause 22 provides for
the withdrawal of deposited securities from a central depository by
depositors. It also provides that all securities withdrawn from a central
depository are required to be registered in the name of the depositor who
withdraws them or in the name of any person nominated by him.


-----

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (CENTRAL DEPOSITORIES) 51

28. _Clause 23 provides that a security which has been withdrawn from_
a central depository may not be traded on a stock market unless it is
redeposited with the central depository. A security that is redeposited is not
capable of being utilised by a depositor to settle a transaction which took
place on a stock market prior to the redeposit of that security.

29. _Clause 24 enables a stock exchange, after consultation with the_

scrips representing any prescribed security which remain undeposited.

30. Division III deals with matters relating to securities accounts and the
keeping of records by a central depository and its authorised depository

authorised depository agents to keep certain records and accounts. Entries

33. Clause 28 requires a central depository to conduct a stock count of
all scrips and other documents respresenting deposited securities held in
custody by, or in the name of, the central depository or its nominee
company. Where the Registrar is dissatisfied with the report of the

appropriate, he may conduct a stock count or he may appoint an approved
company auditor to conduct a stock count.

34. Division IV contains provisions relating to securities transactions,
entries in securities accounts, record of depositors and other related
matters. Clause 29 provides that notwithstanding the provisions of any
written law to the contrary, dealings in deposited securities would be
effected by means of entries in securities accounts. Dealings would
therefore be effective without the need for any instrument in writing or the
need for delivery of the scrip representing those securities.

35. Clause 30 provides that an entry in a securities account in respect of
any dealing shall be deemed to have been made by, or with the authority
of, the central depository or its authorised depository agent.

any deposited security, in the record of depositors shall have all the rights,

obligations in respect of, or arising from such security as if he were a
registered member of the issuer instead of the central depository or its
nominee company in whose name the deposited security is registered.

41. _Clause 36 prohibits a central depository from purchasing, acquiring_
or otherwise dealing in any deposited security as principal. The Minister
may however make regulations specifying the purposes for which, and the
manner in which, a central depository may deal in deposited securities.

42. _Clauses 37 and 38 deals with public offer, bonus issues and rights_
issues. These provisions set out the manner in which securities are to be

security proposed to be listed on a stock exchange or any rights issues in
respect of a deposited security without first having a securities account.

deposited securities are to be dealt with by a central depository or its

chargee or pledgee and securities charged or pledged to them and at the
same time giving the chargee or pledgee control over such securities.
