it has become imperative that the Governor of Bank Negara be
assisted by more Deputies.

2. Clause 1 provides for the short title of the proposed Act.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 8 of the Ordinance to have not
more than three Deputy Governors in the Board of Directors of Bank
Negara.

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 9 of the Ordinance to empower
the Minister to appoint Deputy Governors.

5. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 11 to empower the Minister to
terminate the appointment of Deputy Governors.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 12 to empower the Minister to fill
any casual vacancy in the post of a Deputy Governor.

7. Clauses 2, 3 (b), 3 (c), 3 (d), 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 seek to make
consequential amendments to sections 2,8,13,15,26,30 and 31 of the
Ordinance.
