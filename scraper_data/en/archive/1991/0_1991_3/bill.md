EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to make consequential and other amendments to the
Securities Industry Act 1983.

2. Section 29 of the Securities Industry Act 1983 refers to persons
who are required to comply with Part V of the Act which relates to the
maintenance of a register of securities and matters connected
therewith. Clause 2 seeks to amend subsection 29(1) so that an
authorised depository agent appointed under section 13 of the
Securities Industry (Central Depositories) Act 1991 will also be
required to maintain such a register.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 40 of the Act by deleting
subsection (4) to enable dealers when dealing as principals to charge
a person brokerage, commission or any other fee in respect of a
transaction. At present, subsection (4) forbids the charging of such
brokerage, commission or any other fee. This amendment is aimed at
encouraging brokers to play a part in stabilising short term price
fluctuation. Further, the presence of market makers would enhance
liquidity and marketability of shares.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1616.]


Amendment
of section 40.
