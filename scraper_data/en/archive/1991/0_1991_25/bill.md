**EXTRADITION** **41**

**EXPLANATORY STATEMENT**

This Bill seeks to consolidate the provisions of the Extradition
Ordinance, 1958 and the Commonwealth Fugitive Criminals Act,

1967 and to make new provisions relating to the extradition of

fugitive criminals.

2. Part I deals with preliminary matters.

_Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions relating to the_

application of this Bill to certain countries.

_Clause 2 seeks to confer upon the Minister the power to order_

that this Bill shall apply to a country with which Malaysia has an
arrangement for the extradition of fugitive criminals. Clause 3
seeks to empower the Minister to direct that this Bill shall apply
in relation to the extradition of a particular fugitive criminal to a
country in respect of which no order under clause 2 has been made.
_Clause 4 seeks to allow the Minister to direct the application of_
the procedure in clause 20 to a fugitive criminal in a case where
Malaysia has an arrangement with the country which seeks such
fugitive criminal's return providing for the waiver of the prima

_facie requirement._

_Clause 5 contains the definitions of certain terms found in this_

Bill.

3. Part II deals with extradition offences.

_Clause 6 describes what is meant by the term "extradition_

offence". Clause 7 makes it clear that whenever there is a reference
in this Bill to the law of a country, that reference includes the law
in force in a part of that country.

4. Part III deals with the return of a fugitive criminal to a country
which seeks his return.

_Clause 8 seeks to impose certain restrictions on the return of_

fugitive criminals. Among others, a fugitive criminal cannot be
surrendered to a country which seeks his return if the offence for
which his return is sought is a political offence, or if he is going
to be prosecuted or punished because of his race, religion,
nationality or political opinion or if his prosecution is barred by
time. Clause 9 contains exceptions to the restriction in clause 8 on
political offences.

_Clause 10 seeks to require a country to which a fugitive criminal_

has been returned for an extradition offence to obtain the consent
of the Minister if it wishes to try such criminal for another
extradition offence committed prior to his return, or if such country
wishes to extradite such criminal to any other country to be tried
or punished for any other offence.


-----

42 BILL

5. Part IV deals with the procedure for the return of fugitive
criminals.

_Clause 11 provides that a fugitive criminal may be arrested and_

returned to the country which seeks his return if a requisition, under
_clause 12, for his return is made to the Minister by a diplomatic_
representative of such country. The Minister may then issue an
order to a Magistrate authorising him to issue a warrant for the
arrest of such fugitive criminal. Clause 13 seeks to empower a
Magistrate, if an order under clause 12 has been issued, to issue
a warrant for the arrest of a fugitive criminal. If no order has been
issued under clause 12 the Magistrate may issue a provisional
warrant. If he issues a provisional warrant then, under clause 14,
he must send a report of the issue of such warrant to the Minister.

_Clause 15 seeks to provide for the procedure in respect of a_

fugitive criminal arrested under a warrant issued by a Magistrate
under clause 13, while clause 16 seeks to provide for the procedure
in respect of a fugitive criminal arrested under a provisional warrant
issued under clause 13. Clause 17 contains the procedure to be
followed in respect of a fugitive criminal who is arrested on a
provisional warrant and brought before a Magistrate who has
received an order of the Minister under clause 12.

_Clause 18 sets out the powers and jurisdiction of the Sessions_

Court in relation to an extradition matter brought before it and
_clause 19 sets out the procedure to be followed by such Sessions_
Court. Clause 20 contains the special procedure to be followed by
a Sessions Court in cases where the Minister has issued a direction
under clause 4.

Under clause 21, if a Sessions Court commits a fugitive criminal

to prison to await the Minister's order for his surrender to the
country which seeks his return, such Court must inform him that
he will not be surrendered until after a period of not less than
fifteen days and that he has a right to apply for a writ of habeas
_corpus. He may then, under a surrender warrant issued by the_
Minister, be surrendered to a person duly authorised to receive him
by the country which seeks his return.

_Clause 22 contains the procedure to be followed where a fugitive_

criminal who is brought before a Sessions Court consents to waive
the committal proceedings before that Court.

_Clause 23 seeks to enable certain documents to be received in_

evidence in proceedings under this Bill if such documents are duly
authenticated; and such documents are deemed to be duly
authenticated if they are authenticated as provided in clause 24.

criminals to Brunei Darussalam and the Republic of Singapore.

_Clause 25 contains the provisions making Part VI applicable to_

Brunei Darussalam and Singapore and the definition of the term
"offence".

_Clause 26 seeks to empower a Magistrate in Malaysia to_

endorse a warrant issued by a judicial authority in Brunei
Darussalam or Singapore authorising the arrest of a person who is
accused or convicted of an offence and who is believed to be in
Malaysia.

Under clause 27 a warrant issued in Malaysia but endorsed and

executed in Brunei Darussalam or Singapore will be deemed to
have been validly executed as if it had been executed in Malaysia.

_Clause 28 contains the procedure for the transfer to Brunei_

Darussalam or Singapore of fugitive criminals arrested under a
warrant executed in Malaysia pursuant to clause 26.

_1._ Part VI deals with matters relating to the return of a fugitive

criminal who is serving a sentence in Malaysia to stand trial in the
country which seeks his return.

_Clause 29 contains the procedure for the return of such a fugitive_

criminal. The requisition for his return must be made to the Minister
by a diplomatic representative of the country which seeks his
return. That country -will be required to give an undertaking, inter
_alia, that he will be immediately returned to Malaysia upon the_
completion of his trial. However, under clause 30, if he ceases,
while he is in that other country, to be liable to serve the sentence
in Malaysia, such undertaking need no longer be complied with.
The time spent by such fugitive criminal in custody in connection
with his return under clause 29 will be counted as time served
towards his sentence in Malaysia.

Under clause 3J, the Minister may issue a warrant for the return

to another country of a fugitive criminal who has been returned to
that country and subsequently returned to Malaysia if that country
still seeks the criminal's return after he has served his sentence in
Malaysia.

8. Part VII deals with the return of accused or convicted persons

to Malaysia.

_Clause 32 defines the term "extraditable offences"._

_Clause 33 contains provisions for the conveyance of accused_

persons who are returned to Malaysia by another country.

country which returned him.

review.

Under clause 36 a fugitive criminal may apply to the High Court

for a writ of habeas corpus.

High Court for a review of an order of discharge made by a

Under clause 38 every colony or constituent part of a country

and every vessel or aircraft of that country is deemed to be within
the jurisdication of and part of that country.

jurisdiction to try that offence.

_Clause 40 seeks to empower the Minister to direct the detention_

of a fugitive criminal on transit to a country which seeks his return.
