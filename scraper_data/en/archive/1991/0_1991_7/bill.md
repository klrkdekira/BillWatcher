EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to make better provisions for the care and protection
of children who need protection.

2. Part I contains preliminary matters and sets out the definitions of
certain terms used in this Bill.

The term "child" is defined, in clause 2, to mean a person under the
age of eighteen years. Subclause 2 (2) sets out the various
circumstances which must exist in relation to a child before a child can
be classified as a "child in need of protection".

3. Part II deals with the appointment of Protectors and Registrar of
Children in Need of Protection as well as the keeping and maintenance
of a Register of Children in Need of Protection.


Consequential
amendments
and repeal.
_Act 90._

_Act 232._


-----

36 BILL

_Clause 3 empowers the Minister to appoint Protectors._

_Clause 4 empowers the Minister to appoint a Registrar of Children_
in Need of Protection who, under the provisions of clause 5, has the
duty to keep and maintain a Register of Children in Need of Protection.
This Register shall contain details of every case and suspected case of
a child in need of protection.

Under clause 7 details in the Register may be furnished only to the
Court and to certain persons for certain purposes only. Clause 8 makes
it an offence for such details to be furnished to other persons.

4. Part III provides for the establishment of a Co-ordinating Council
for the Protection of Children and Child Protection Teams.

_Clauses 9,10 and 11 deal with the establishment of the Council, the_
membership of the Council and the sitting and conduct of the Council's
proceedings, respectively.

_Clause 12 seeks to require the Council to establish Child Protection_
Teams thoroughout the country for the purpose of coordinating
locally-based services to families and children where children are or
are suspected to be in need of protection.

5. Part IV deals with the temporary custody of children in need of
protection and medical examination and treatment of such children.

_Clause 13 empowers a Protector or police officer to take into_
temporary custody any child whom he believes is in need of protection.
Such child must be placed in a place of safety until he can be brought
before the Juvenile Court.

_Clause 14 empowers a Protector or police officer to produce a child_
in need of protection before a medical officer if such Protector or
police officer is of the opinion that the child needs medical
examination or treatment.

_Clause 15 deals with the medical examination and treatment of_
children in need of protection who are brought before a medical
officer under clause 14.

_Clause 16 enables a Protector or police officer to authorize the_
treatment of children in need of protection. If a child is suffering from
a serious illness or requires surgery or psychiatric treatment, a
Protector or police officer must endeavour to notify and consult the
guardian and authorization may be given with the consent of such
guardian. However if such consent cannot be obtained or there is
immediate risk to the health of the child, the Protector may authorize
any treatment considered necessary by a medical officer.

_Clause 17 seeks to make a Protector or police officer who authorizes_
the medical examination or treatment of a child under clause 15 or 16
or a medical officer who examines or treats such child not liable at law
by reason only that such child is examined or treated under such
clause.


-----

CHILD PROTECTION 37

_Clause 18 seeks to confer upon the Director General control over all_
children in need of protection who are hospitalized and to impose a
duty on him to maintain such children for the duration of such
hospitalization.

_Clause 19 seeks to require every medical practitioner to notify a_
Protector if he believes on reasonable grounds that the child he is
treating is physically or emotionally injured as a result of being abused
