EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Local Government Act 1976.

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 107 of the same Act by
inserting new subsections (1A), (2A), (7) and (8).

Subsection (1 A) seeks to allow any licence or permit granted
under the Act to be issued jointly with any other licence or permit.
This will be very helpful to traders and investors who may have
applied for more than one licence or permit in order to set up their
businesses. It will promote the growth of any trade, occupation,
investment and development in the country.

Subsection (2A) provides that the revocation of any particular
licence or permit issued jointly with any other licence or permit
under subsection (1 A) shall not affect the validity of any other
licence or permit with which it had been jointly issued.

The existing subsection (4) has been amended to increase the
validity of a licence from a period not exceeding twelve months
to a period not exceeding three years.

Subsection (7) has been introduced to provide for a certified true
copy of the licence to be used for the purpose of subsection (5)
or (6) of the Act.

Subsection (8) seeks to provide for the certification of any
licence as a true copy by the President, Secretary or any officer
authorised by the President in writing.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1491/1.]
