EXPLANATORY STATEMENT


_Act_


This Bill seeks to make consequential amendments to the Companies
Act 1965 which are made necessary by the introduction of the
proposed Securities Industry (Central Depositories) Bill.

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend subsection 6A (10) by inserting a new
paragraph (d) so that an interest in a share shall not be disregarded
only by the fact that the share is held by, or in the name of, the
central depository or its nominee company.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend subsection 39 (1) relating to the
contents of prospectuses. The new paragraph (j) provides that where
shares, notes or other securities have been specified by a stock
exchange as a prescribed security under section 14 of the proposed
Securities Industry (Central Depositories) Act 1991, the prospectus
shall state that such shares, notes or other securities have been so
prescribed and that applicants are required to have securities
accounts when making their applications.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1643.]
