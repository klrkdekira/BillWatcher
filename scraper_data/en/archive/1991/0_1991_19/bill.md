_2 BILL_

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Federal Constitution.

2. Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend Article 54 of the Federal
Constitution to provide that any vacancy among members of the
Senate is to be filled within sixty days from the date such vacancy
is established by the President of the Senate, instead of by the
Election Commission as is the case now, in view of the fact that the
Election Commission is not involved in the process of filling up a
vacancy in the Senate.

3. _Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend Article 132 of the_
Constitution to remove the railway service from the list of public
services in that Article. The railway service will, after the
amendment, become part of the general public service of the
Federation, under the jurisdiction of the Public Services
Commission. In fact it is that Commission which now has
jurisdiction over members of the railway service. It assumed such
jurisdiction when the railway service ceased to have its own
Commission in 1981.

4. The amendment proposed in clause 4 is a consequential
amendment.

_FINANCIAL_ _IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure. [PN. (U[2]) 1548,]
