EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Employees' Social Security Act 1969
(hereinafter referred to as the "Act").

2. Clause 2 seeks to amend the long title of the Act to provide
for a wider scope of the social security scheme.

3. Clause 3 seeks to amend section 2 of the Act to introduce a
new definition of 'dependants' and to define the word "Fund".


-----

26 BILL

4. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 3 of the Act to extend the
coverage of the social security scheme to industries having one or
more employees. At present the social security scheme only covers
all industries employing five or more persons.

5. Clause 5 deals with a consequential amendment.

_6. Clause 6(a) seeks to amend section 9A of the Act by deleting_
the word "insurable" which appears before the words "employees"
and "employment". This has been done for purposes of ensuring
consistency in the usage of terms throughout the Act. Clause 6
_(b) seeks to clarify the position between the proviso to section 9A_
and the proviso to subsection (2) of section 7 in respect of the
recovery of arrears of contributions by the employer through the
deduction of the employee's wages.

7. Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 9e to the Act.
Section 9s is a validating provision to legalise and validate any
contribution which has been collected by the Organisation for any
employee who was not registered for purposes of insurance under
the Act for any period prior to the 1st July 1987, that is, the date
of the coming into force of the existing section 9A.

8. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 12 of the Act to widen the_

jurisdiction of-the inspectors appointed under the Act.

9. Clause 9 provides for any order made under section 13 to be
served either personally or by registered post.

10. Clause 10 seeks to amend section 15 by deleting the words

which are now considered unnecessary.

11. Clauses 11 and 12 seek to amend sections 17 and I?A of the

Act respectively to reduce the qualifying period for invalidity
pension from thirty-six months to twenty-four months to enable
more insured persons to be covered under the invalidity pension
scheme.

12. _Clause 13 seeks to amend the Act by deleting section_ 18.

The provisions therein contained will now be incorporated into the
new section 19.

13. _Clause 14_ seeks to amend section 19 of the Act to provide

for the payment of invalidity pension to accrue from the day the
insured person gives notice of invalidity and to cease on the day
following the day in which invalidity ceases or the day the
pensioner dies. Clause 14 also seeks to introduce a new method
of computing the payment of invalidity pension by dividing the
monthly rate of invalidity pension paid or payable with the number
of days in the month in which the pension accrues or the invalidity
ceases or the pensioner dies.

eighty-six sen subject to such other amount as may be prescribed
by the Minister in the regulations.

provision to cover any accident suffered by the insured person

while travelling on a journey made for any of the purposes

18. _Clause 20 seeks to amend section 31 of the Act to provide_

that the insured person or his dependants are not allowed to claim
any compensation or damages from the employer of the insured
person or any servant of such employer under any other law for
the time being in force in respect of any employment injury

sustained as an employee under the Act.

19. Clause 21 seeks to introduce a new section 33A to empower

the Organisation, in its discretion, to refer a case to a medical
board for determination of the invalidity question or disablement
question in circumstances where the insured person, after
submitting his notice of invalidity or application for reference to
a medical board, dies before being examined by such medical
board.

allow an insured person who has to undergo rehabilitation to be
reimbursed by the Organisation irrespective of whether he is

of the establishment of a Promotion Board under the Act.

23. Clause 26 seeks to introduce the new sections 59Q, 59R, 59s,
59T, 59u, 59v and 59w. Sections 59Q, 59R and 59T provide for the

for the consolidation of the existing funds of the Organisation. The
consolidation is necessary to ensure flexibility in expenditure and
in the management of the Fund.

25. Clauses 24, 28 and 29 are consequential amendments
necessitated by the consolidation of the funds of the Organisation.

26. _Clause 30 seeks to amend section 72 of the Act to render_

it lawful for the Fund of the Organisation to be expended for the
welfare and recreational purposes of the officers and servants of
the Organisation.

27. _Clause 31 seeks to introduce a new section 72A to enable the_

Fund of the Organisation to be expended for the purpose of granting
loans to officers and servants of the Organisation.

28. _Clause 32 seeks to amend section 75A of the Act to enable_

the Director-General to act as the Deputy Chairman of the
Investment Panel.

29. _Clause 33_ seeks to introduce a new section 75B which

provides that in the absence of the Chairman of the Investment
Panel due to illness or other causes, the Investment Panel will be
presided by the Director-General as Deputy Chairman. This will

enable the Investment Panel to function despite the absence of the
Chairman.

30. _Clause 34_ seeks to amend section 83 of the Act by

introducing the new subsections (6), (7) and (8) to empower the
Minister to nominate an alternate member to each member of the
Social Security Appellate Board whenever such member is unable
to attend the proceedings of the Appellate Board due to illness or
other causes. This will ensure that the proceedings of the Appellate
Board can continue despite the absence of the member.

31. _Clause 35 seeks to amend section 93 of the Act to make it_

an offence for any person to make in writing or to sign any
declaration or other document required under the Act which is

the existing section 96(1)(b). This will then enable the insured
person who is entitled to the benefits under the Act to be


-----

EMPLOYEES' SOCIAL SECURITY (AMENDMENT) 29

compensated under the Workmen's Compensation Act 1952 if the
disablement of the insured person was due to any employment
injury sustained as an employee.

34. Clause 38 seeks to amend section 96A of the Act to enable
the dependant who is entitled to the benefits under the Act to be
compensated under the Workmen's Compensation Act 1952 if the
death of the insured person was due to any employment injury
sustained as an employee.

35. _Clause 39 seeks to amend section 100 of the Act to empower_

the Minister to exempt any industry or class of industries belonging
to any statutory authority from the operation of the Act.

section 105 of the Act. This is necessitated by the consolidation

of the funds of the Organisation.

Act to stipulate the amount of the monthly rate of invalidity pension
to be paid to the dependants where the invalidity pensioner dies
before 1st February 1986.

38. Clause 42 seeks to introduce the new sections 111 and 112.
Section 111 gives the power to the Organisation to deal directly
with the insured person or his dependants or any authorised person
only. This is to prevent any other person from making any claim
on behalf of the insured person or his dependants for such person's
personal gains. Section 112 disallows a person sustaining
permanent disablement as a result of two or more successive
accidents to receive, in the same period, disablement benefit for
permanent disablement in exces's of the daily rate for permanent
total disablement.

39. _Clause 43 seeks to amend paragraph (1) of the First Schedule._

Under the existing provision the Act covers any person whose
wages do not exceed one thousand dollars a month. With the

amendment the ambit of the Act is increased to cover all persons
earning up to two thousand ringgit a month. A new proviso is
introduced to allow any person, whose wages exceed two thousand
ringgit a month, and his employer to elect, on a voluntary basis,
to make contributions under the Act. In such a case then the person
is deemed to be an employee under the Act.

_Clause 43 also seeks to delete paragraphs (9), (10) and (11) of_

the same Schedule. This is done in order to include under the social
security scheme all nomadic aborigines, persons who are employed
for catching fish in maritime waters or employed on board any
vessel for such purpose, and all agricultural workers who are
employed for the purpose of cultivating, upkeeping and-harvesting
padi.
