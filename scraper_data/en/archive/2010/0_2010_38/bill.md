EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1952 (“Ordinance”)
to provide for matters that include the implementation of the Convention on
Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976 as amended by the Protocol
of 1996 to amend the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime
Claims 1976 (“Convention”) in Malaysia.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.


-----

26 _Bill_

3. _Clause 2 seeks to delete subsection 300(3) of the Ordinance as section_
493 of the Ordinance as amended by _clause 28_ provides in respect of the
prosecution of offences under the Ordinance or any subsidiary legislation
made thereunder.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to provide for the amendment of the definition of certain_
terms under Part VA of the Ordinance to comply with the International
Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as amended by
the Protocol of 1978, of which Malaysia is already a Party. _Clause 4 seeks_
to amend certain provisions under Part VA of the Ordinance, namely, sections
306B, 306CA, 306D, 306G, 306I, 306J, 306JA and 306Q, to extend the application
of that Part to the exclusive economic zone.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to substitute Part IX of the Ordinance and introduces the_
new sections 358 to 365A. The new section 360 provides for the implementation
of the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976 as
amended by the Protocol of 1996 to amend the Convention on Limitation of
Liability for Maritime Claims 1976, while the new section 361 requires ships
that enter or leave a port in Malaysia, or any part of Malaysian waters or the
exclusive economic zone to have in force in respect of the ship a contract
of insurance or other financial security satisfying the requirements of the
Convention in respect of the limits of liability. The new section 364 empowers
the Minister to exclude the application of the provisions as set out in the
section, and to exclude from the Convention claims for damage within the
meaning of the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for
Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances
by Sea, 1996 or of any amendment or protocol thereto. This _clause also_
introduces a new section 365A that requires an owner of a ship to maintain a
contract of insurance or other financial security in respect of the master and
seamen carried on board the ship to cover all claims arising out of a contract
or otherwise in respect of the death, personal injury or abandonment of the
master or seamen.

6. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 366 of the Ordinance to introduce the_
definition of “owner” for the purposes of Part X in respect of wrecks and
salvage.

7. _Clause 7 seeks to substitute section 381 of the Ordinance to provide for_
the removal of wrecks in any port, navigable river, tidal waters or in any
place within Malaysian waters that in the opinion of the receiver is a wreck
that is a hazard to navigation, a public nuisance, or causes inconvenience or
harmful consequences to the marine environment.

8. _Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section 381A that requires the owner_
of a ship of 300 tons and above to maintain a contract of insurance or other
financial security to cover liability that may be incurred and as set out in
section 381 as introduced by _clause 7._

9. _Clauses 9 to 26 seek to amend sections 405, 423, 425, 426, 452, 455, 458,_
460, 462, 465, 469, 470, 471, 474, 483B, 484, 486 and 487 of the Ordinance,
respectively, to provide for an increase in the fines that may be imposed in
respect of offences committed under those sections.


-----

_Merchant Shipping (Amendment and Extension)_ 27

10. _Clause 27 seeks to amend section 491C of the Ordinance to enable the_
Director of Marine to carry out, without a warrant, the powers conferred upon
him under that section.

11. _Clause 28 seeks to substitute section 493 of the Ordinance to provide_
that the prosecution of an offence under the Ordinance or any subsidiary
legislation made thereunder shall be instituted with the consent of the Public
Prosecutor.

12. _Clause 30 seeks to delete section 497 of the Ordinance regarding_
provisions on the limitation of time in respect of proceedings for an offence
or that arises from a cause of complaint instituted in a Sessions Court or a
Magistrate’s Court. However specific provisions in the Ordinance in respect
of the limitation of time will continue to apply. _Clause 29 provides for an_
amendment consequential to the amendment proposed in _clause 30._

13. _Clause 31 seeks to amend section 512A of the Ordinance in respect of_
the compounding of offences under the Ordinance.

14. _Clause 32 seeks to substitute section 516 of the Ordinance by introducing_
the definition of the term “owners” for the purposes of sections 513 to 515
of the Ordinance.

15. _Clause 33 seeks to introduce the new Sixteenth Schedule that sets out_
the provisions in the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime
Claims 1976 as amended by the Protocol of 1996 to amend the Convention
on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976.

16. _Clause 34 seeks to extend Parts III, IV, VI, VIII and IX of the Ordinance_
to Sabah and Sarawak in order to standardise the laws relating to masters and
seamen, passenger ships, load line and loading and liability of shipowners
for the whole of Malaysia. The equivalent provisions under the Merchant
Shipping Ordinance 1960 of Sabah and the Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1960
of Sarawak are currently no longer utilised. This _clause_ also seeks to extend
Part X of the Ordinance relating to wrecks and salvage to Sabah and Sarawak
to ensure uniform laws in relation thereto for the whole of Malaysia.

17. _Clauses 35 and 36 seek to repeal corresponding provisions in regulations_
made under the Merchant Shipping Ordinance 1960 of Sarawak, and to provide
that Parts III, IV, VI, VIII, IX and X of the Ordinance shall prevail over
inconsistent or contrary provisions in any other written laws.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
