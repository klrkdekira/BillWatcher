4 _Bill_

(6) A reference in any written law or document in force,
immediately before the appointed date to the Director General of
Railways under the Act in respect of its application to Peninsular
Malaysia, shall be construed as a reference to the Suruhanjaya
Pengangkutan Awam Darat established under the Suruhanjaya
Pengangkutan Awam Darat Act 2010 [Act ].

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Railways Act 1991 (“Act 463”) mainly as a
consequence to the establishment of the Suruhanjaya Pengangkutan Awam
Darat which shall be responsible for a safe, reliable and efficient land public
transport including the railways in Peninsular Malaysia via the implementation
of the Land Public Transport Act 2010. As the Suruhanjaya Pengangkutan
Awam Darat will be responsible to implement the Land Public Transport Act
2010 in Peninsular Malaysia, this Bill seeks to amend Act 463 to make the
provisions of Act 463, except Part XII which shall apply throughout Malaysia,
to only apply to Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territory of Labuan.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint_
the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to define “appointed date”.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend sections 1, 4 and 7 of Act 463 in respect of the_
application of Act 463 to only Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territory of
Labuan.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to introduce a new subsection 1(1A) into Act 463 in
relation to the application of Part XII of Act 463 to all railways in Malaysia
notwithstanding the amendments made under _clause 3. This will preserve the_
role and function of the Railway Asset Corporation in relation to railways all
over Malaysia.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend certain definitions in Act 463 consequential to
the non-application of Act 463, except Part XII, to Peninsular Malaysia.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 66 of Act 463 to impose on a person_
who is convicted of maliciously obstructing or attempting to obstruct a railway,
with both fine and imprisonment.

8. _Clause 7_ seeks to amend section 89 of Act 463 to avoid the overlapping
of functions between the Railways Asset Commission and the Suruhanjaya
Pengangkutan Awam Darat in relation to the development of railways.

_9. Clause 8 seeks to establish non-application, saving and transition provision_
of matters related to Act 463 as consequences of the non-applicability of Act
463, except Part XII, to Peninsular Malaysia.
