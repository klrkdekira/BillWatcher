prohibition under section 4 based on the following reasons:

_(b) the benefits could not reasonably have been provided_
by the parties to the agreement without the agreement
having the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting
competition;

is proportionate to the benefits provided; and

to eliminate competition completely in respect of a
substantial part of the goods or services.

with respect to a particular agreement from the prohibition under
section 4.

agreements are, in the opinion of the Commission, likely to be
agreements to which section 5 applies, the Commission may,
by order published in the _Gazette, grant an exemption to the_

in writing, cancel the block exemption in respect of the
agreement;

by other parties of supplementary conditions which by
their nature or according to commercial usage have no
connection with the subject matter of the contract;

_(f) any predatory behaviour towards competitors; or_

where the enterprise in a dominant position does not
have a reasonable commercial justification for buying
up the intermediate goods or resources to meet its own
needs.

position from taking any step which has reasonable commercial
justification or represents a reasonable commercial response to
the market entry or market conduct of a competitor.

conclusive as to whether that enterprise occupies, or does not
occupy, a dominant position in that market.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Competition Act 2010 (“the Act”) as proposed by this Bill seeks to
introduce prohibitions on anti-competitive conduct and practices. The object
of the Act is to promote economic development by protecting the process of
competition, and thereby protecting the interest of consumers.

The Act makes provision for the introduction of competition law by
introducing two main prohibitions. The first is in respect of agreements or
concerted practices between enterprises or association of enterprises (together
referred to as “agreements”) which have the object or effect, of significantly
preventing, restricting or distorting competition in Malaysia. The second is
the prohibition of the abuse by an enterprise or enterprises of a dominant
position in Malaysia.

PART I

2. Part I deals with preliminary matters.

3. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the Act and empowers the Minister_
to appoint the date for the coming into operation of the Act.

4. _Clause 2_ contains the definition of certain expressions used in the Act.

5. _Clause 3 provides for the application of the Act and seeks to establish_
the extra-territorial application of the Act which is necessary to ensure that
any commercial activity transacted outside Malaysia which has an effect on
competition in any market in Malaysia is subject to the Act.

PART II

Chapter 1

6. Part II contains the prohibitions on anti-competitive agreements and the
abuse of a dominant position.

46 _Bill_

7. _Clause 4 seeks to prohibit agreements, both horizontal and vertical, which_
have the object or effect of significantly preventing, restricting or distorting
competition in any market for goods or services in Malaysia.

8. _Clause 5 seeks to allow an enterprise which is a party to any particular_
agreement to relieve its liability from the prohibition under _clause 4 if the_
criteria as set out in _clause 5 are satisfied. The same criteria are also used in_
determining the grant of individual and block exemption. In order to relieve
its liability, an enterprise is required to establish that the benefits derived from
an agreement outweigh any anti-competitive effects. This is established by
proving that there are technological, efficiency or social benefits arising from
the agreement and these benefits could not be achieved without the agreement
incurring an anti-competitive effect which is proportionate to the benefits
provided and the agreement does not eliminate competition completely.

9. _Clause 6 empowers the Competition Commission (“Commission”) to_
grant an individual exemption from the _clause 4 prohibition to any particular_
agreement which meets the criteria specified under _clause 5._

10. _Clause 7 empowers the Commission to cancel an individual exemption_
or vary the condition or obligation imposed.

from the _clause 4 prohibition (“block exemption”) which meet the criteria_
specified under clause 5.

12. _Clause 9 provides for the procedure of the Commission in granting block_
exemption.

Chapter 2

13. _Clause 10 seeks to prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. It contains_
an illustrative but non-exhaustive list of conduct which may constitute an
abuse of dominant position.

Chapter 3

14. _Clause 11 seeks to empower the Commission to conduct a review into_
any market in order to determine whether any feature or combination of
features of the market prevents, restricts or distorts competition in the market
and clause 12 requires the Commission to publish a report of its findings and
recommendations.

Chapter 4

15. _Clause 13 excludes certain types of activities as specified in the Second_
Schedule from the prohibitions under Part II and empowers the Minister to
amend the Second Schedule. This _clause requires the Minister to give due_
consideration to any submission made by members of the public in relation
to the proposed amendment to the Second Schedule before making the
amendment.
