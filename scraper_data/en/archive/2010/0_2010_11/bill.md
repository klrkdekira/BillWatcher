and descents and other convenient approaches instead
of crossing the road on the level; or

for removing or diminishing the danger arising from the
level crossing and for meeting the convenience of the
public.

existing railway track, the Government Entity responsible for the

as the railway company may determine.

(4) The railway company may, from time to time, define

declaration under this section, the railway official may detain
and examine the goods.

in, upon and in respect of the premises all the powers referred

within the jurisdiction of an appropriate authority as specified in paragraphs
67(a), (b), (c) and (e) of the Road Transport Act 1987, the concurrence of that
