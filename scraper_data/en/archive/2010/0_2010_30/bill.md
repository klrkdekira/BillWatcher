[ ]

**ENACTED by the Parliament of Malaysia as follows:**

**Short title**

**1. This Act may be cited as the Fees (Malaysian Meteorological**
Department) (Validation) Act 2010.

**Validation and indemnity**

**2. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Fees Act 1951**

[Act 209], the fees which were charged and collected by
the Malaysian Meteorological Department in respect of any
meteorological service and publication during the period from
1 January 1973 to 31 December 2009 shall be deemed to have
been validly charged and collected.

2 _Bill_

(2) No action or legal proceeding shall be brought, instituted
or maintained against the Government of Malaysia or any officer
of the Government of Malaysia or any person acting under them
in respect of any fees which were charged and collected, and if
any such action or legal proceeding has been brought, instituted
or maintained, it shall be discharged and made void and no refund
in respect of the fees charged and collected as stated in this Act
shall be made.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to validate the collection of fees which were charged and
collected in respect of any meteorological service and publication during
the period from 1 January 1973 (that is from the day on which the fees
were first collected) to 31 December 2009 (being the day before the date of
coming into operation of the Fees (Services and Publications of the Malaysian
Meteorological Department) Order 2010 [P.U. (A) 1/2010]). The fees had been
paid to and collected by the Malaysian Meteorological Department. However,
the fees charged and collected were not gazetted under the Fees Act 1951
by way of a Fees Order which should have been enacted and made effective
from 1 January 1973.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.

[PN(U[2])2706]
