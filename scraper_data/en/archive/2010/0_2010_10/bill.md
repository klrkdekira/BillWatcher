EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board Act 1987
(“Act 334”) to provide for consequential changes to Act 334 pursuant to the
proposed Suruhanjaya Pengangkutan Awam Darat Act 2010 and the proposed
Land Public Transport Act 2010. The proposed Suruhanjaya Pengangkutan
Awam Darat Act 2010 seeks to establish the Suruhanjaya Pengangkutan Awam
Darat (“Commission”) as the principal regulator for land public transport, which
includes public service vehicles and goods vehicles for Peninsular Malaysia,
whilst the proposed Land Public Transport Act 2010 sets out the regulatory
framework for land public transport for Peninsular Malaysia. Thus, after
the commencement of the proposed Suruhanjaya Pengangkutan Awam Darat
Act 2010 and the proposed Land Public Transport Act 2010, Act 334 will only
apply to Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territory of Labuan.

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and enables the Minister to appoint the
commencement date of this Bill.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to introduce the definition of “appointed date” of this_
Bill.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to make amendments to section 1 of Act 334 to clarify
that Act 334 will only apply to Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territory of
Labuan.

5. _Clauses 4_ and _5_ seek to amend sections 2 and 3 respectively of
Act 334 to delete references made to the Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board
Peninsular Malaysia which is dissolved by this proposed Act.

6. _Clauses 6, 7_ and 8 seek to propose further consequential amendments to
sections 4, 9 and 27 respectively of Act 334.

7. _Clause 9 seeks to provide for the non-application of Act 334 to Peninsular_
Malaysia, the dissolution of the Board and transitional matters and savings.

8. _Clause 10 provides for the status of existing licences under Act 334._

9. Clause 11 provides for the status of pending applications under Act 334.

10. Clause 12 provides for the status of pending appeals under the Act 334.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
