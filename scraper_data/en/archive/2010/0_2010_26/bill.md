**Admissibility of statements in evidence**


25


**26p. (1) In any trial or inquiry by a Court into an offence**
under this Act, any statement, whether the statement amounts
to a confession or not, is oral or in writing, made at any time,
whether before or after the person is charged and whether
in the course of an investigation under this Act or not and
whether or not wholly or partly in answer to questions, by
an accused person to or in the hearing of an enforcement
officer and whether or not interpreted to him by any other
enforcement officer or any other person, whether concerned
or not in the arrest of that person, shall, notwithstanding any
written law or rule of law to the contrary, be admissible at
his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a
witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination
and for the purpose of impeaching his credit.

(2) No statement made under subsection (1) shall be
admissible or used as provided for in that subsection if the
making of the statement appears to the Court to have been
caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference
to the charge against the person proceeding from a person in
authority and sufficient in the opinion of the Court to give
that person grounds which would appear to him reasonable
for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage
or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the
proceedings against him.

(3) Where any person is arrested or is informed that he
may be prosecuted for any offence under this Act, he shall
be served by the enforcement officer with a notice in writing,
which shall be explained to him, to the following effect:

“You have been arrested/informed that you may be
prosecuted for …………(the possible offence under this
Act). Do you wish to say anything? If there is any fact
on which you intend to rely in your defence in Court,
you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back
till you go to Court, your evidence may be less likely to
be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case
in general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you
would like it written down, this will be done.”.


-----

26 _Bill_

(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), a statement by any
person accused of any offence under this Act made before
there is time to serve a notice under that subsection shall
not be rendered inadmissible in evidence merely by reason
of no such notice having been served on him if such notice
has been served on him as soon as is reasonably possible
thereafter.

(5) No statement made by an accused person in answer
to a written notice served on him pursuant to subsection (3)
shall be construed as a statement caused by any inducement,
threat or promise as is described in subsection (2), if it is
otherwise voluntary.

(6) Where in any criminal proceedings against a person
for an offence under this Act, evidence is given that the
accused, on being informed that he might be prosecuted for
it, failed to mention any such fact, being a fact which in the
circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have
been expected to mention when so informed, the Court, in
determining whether the prosecution has made out a _prima_
_facie_ case against the accused and in determining whether
the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such
inference from the failure as appear proper; and the failure
may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as
capable of amounting to, corroboration of any evidence
given against the accused in relation to which the failure is
material.

(7) Nothing in subsection (6) shall, in any criminal
proceedings—

_(a) prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or_

other reaction of the accused in the face of anything
said in his presence relating to the conduct in respect
of which he is charged, in so far as evidence of
it would be admissible apart from that subsection;
or

_(b) be taken to preclude the drawing of any inference_

from any such silence or other reaction of the accused
which could be drawn apart from that subsection.
