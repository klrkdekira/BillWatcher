the licensee with the introduction of new offences and obligation;

_(c) to enhance the powers of the Registrar of Moneylenders and the_

Inspectors of Moneylenders as well as the members of the Royal
Malaysia Police in relation to the enforcement of Act 400; and

and increasing the penalty for serious offences, i.e. conducting
unlicensed moneylending business and harassment and intimidation
of borrowers.

commencement date of the proposed Act.

of the words “holder of the licence” which will be replaced by the word

that Act 400 applies to the whole of Malaysia. Act 400 was extended to the

canvasser. The proposed section 27b seeks to provide an offence for preparing
moneylending agreement in which the amount is not truly stated or left
blank.

card or charge card is proved to have been used to facilitate the unlicensed
