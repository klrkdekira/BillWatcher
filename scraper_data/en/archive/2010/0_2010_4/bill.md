EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill aims to fight corruption and other wrongdoings in the public and
private sector. In achieving this objective, the public must be encouraged and
facilitated to disclose any act of corruption and other wrongdoings which fall
within the ambit of improper conduct under this Bill. To encourage and facilitate
a disclosure of improper conduct, this Bill seeks to provide for protection
to any person making such disclosure who shall be called a whistleblower.
This Bill accords a whistleblower with protection of confidential information,
immunity against civil and criminal action and protection against detrimental
action. Apart from conferring such protection to a whistleblower, this Bill
further seeks to empower the enforcement agency to conduct investigation into
improper conduct and into complaints of detrimental action and the court to
make orders for remedies. These powers are to ensure that the disclosure of
improper conduct is dealt with accordingly and the whistleblower is adequately
protected.

2. Part I of this Bill deals with preliminary matters.

_Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint_
the commencement date of this Bill.

_Clause 2 contains the definition of the words and expressions used in this_
Bill.

3. Part II of this Bill sets out provisions relating to administration.

_Clause 3 provides that the enforcement agency has general direction, control_
and supervision in all matters in relation to whistleblower protection. It further
spells out the general powers of the enforcement agency.

_Clause 4 seeks to empower the Minister to issue directions as to the exercise_
of the powers, discretions and duties of the enforcement agency.

_Clause 5 seeks to allow the enforcement agency to co-operate with other_
enforcement agencies, any Federal or State Government departments or any
other person should the need arise. Upon request by the enforcement agency, any
person shall provide the enforcement agency with the necessary assistance.

4. Part III of this Bill deals with whistleblower protection.

_Clause 6 seeks to allow the making of disclosure by any person that_
any other person has engaged, is engaging or is preparing to engage in
an improper conduct. Such disclosure may be made orally or in writing to
any enforcement agency based on his reasonable belief. This _clause further_
provides that disclosure of improper conduct may be made against a member
of Parliament or State Legislative Assembly. Any provision in any contract
of employment is void in so far as it purports to preclude the making of a
disclosure of improper conduct.

_Clause 7 seeks to provide for the protection that a whistleblower shall_
enjoy upon receipt of a disclosure of improper conduct by any enforcement
agency. The forms of protection accorded to a whistleblower are protection of
confidential information, immunity from civil and criminal action and protection
against detrimental action. The protection against detrimental action is also
extended to any person related to or associated with the whistleblower. The
main aim of conferring protection to the whistleblower is to encourage the
whistleblower to come forward to make disclosure of improper conduct by
eliminating any kind of fear or risk that may hinder him from making such
disclosure.

_Clause 8_ seeks to impose a statutory obligation to keep information
confidential on any person who makes or receives a disclosure of improper
conduct or obtains confidential information in the course of investigation. It
further provides for the contravention of such obligation to be an offence. This
_clause also prohibits the disclosure of particulars which leads or is likely to_
lead to the discovery of the whistleblower during any proceedings.

_Clause 9 seeks to confer immunity from civil and criminal liability or any_
liability arising by way of administrative process to a whistleblower in order
to encourage a whistleblower to come forward to disclose improper conduct
without fear.

_Clause 10 seeks to prohibit any person from taking any form of detrimental_
action against a whistleblower or any person related to or associated with the
whistleblower in reprisal of a disclosure of improper conduct. This clause sets
out the circumstances in which an action amounts to a detrimental action. It
further provides for the contravention of such prohibition to be an offence.

_Clause 11 deals with_ the circumstances where whistleblower protection is
revoked which include participation of the whistleblower himself in the improper
conduct, the disclosure is frivolous or vexatious and the disclosure is made
to avoid disciplinary action. In the event that the whistleblower protection is
revoked, the whistleblower shall be informed and if he is not satisfied with
the revocation, the whistleblower may appeal against the revocation to the
court.

5. Part IV of this Bill contains provisions relating to the dealing with
disclosure of improper conduct.

_Clause 12 seeks to provide for the enforcement agency receiving a disclosure_
of improper conduct to carry out investigation into such disclosure and prepare
a report.

_Clause 13 states that if the report prepared by the enforcement agency_
finds that there is no substantiated case, the whistleblower shall be informed.
Otherwise, if the report finds that there is a disciplinary offence, the case shall
be referred to the relevant authority of the public body or private body who shall
inform the enforcement agency of the steps taken or to be taken or the reason
for not taking action. The enforcement agency may report to the Minister if
no action is taken or the action taken is insufficient. On the other hand, if the
report finds that there is a criminal offence and the Public Prosecutor decides
to prosecute, the enforcement agency has to obtain periodical reporting or if
the Public Prosecutor decides not to prosecute, the enforcement agency has to
inform the whistleblower. This clause also requires the enforcement agency to
inform the whistleblower of the result of investigation and the action taken.

6. Part V of this Bill contains provisions relating to the complaints of
detrimental action and remedies.

_Clause 14 seeks to allow the enforcement agency to conduct investigation_
into complaints of detrimental action. It further requires the enforcement agency
to record its finding and refer the matter to the Public Prosecutor upon the
completion of its investigation into complaints of detrimental action. If the
investigation shows that there is no substantiated case, the whistleblower shall
be informed. Otherwise, if the investigation shows that there is a disciplinary
offence, the case shall be referred to the relevant authority of the public body
or private body who shall inform the enforcement agency of the steps taken or
to be taken or the reason for not taking action. The enforcement agency may
report to the Minister if no action is taken or the action taken is insufficient.
On the other hand, if the investigation shows that there is a criminal offence
and the Public Prosecutor decides to prosecute, the enforcement agency has to

obtain periodical reporting or if the Public Prosecutor decides not to prosecute,
the enforcement agency has to inform the whistleblower. If a charge is made,
any evidence may be used for the proceedings subject to clause 8. This clause
also requires the enforcement agency to inform the whistleblower of the result
of investigation and the action taken.

_Clause 15 authorizes the enforcement agency to file application to the_ court
upon request by a whistleblower to seek remedies available which are damages
or compensation, injunction or any other relief as the court deems fit. This
_clause also requires a whistleblower or any person related to or associated_
with the whistleblower who intends to seek the remedies provided through
another person to notify the enforcement agency of such intention to enable
the enforcement agency to make an application to the court to discharge itself
or discontinue from representing the whistleblower or that person. When
the enforcement agency discovers that the whistleblower or that person has
sought the remedies through another person, the enforcement agency may
also discharge itself or discontinue from representation. The whistleblower
or that person shall then reimburse the enforcement agency for any expenses
incurred.

_Clause 16 imposes liability on any person who commits detrimental action_
in reprisal against a whistleblower or any person related to or associated with
the whistleblower. This liability shall be borne by that person in his personal
capacity. Despite the right for damages, the whistleblower or any person
related to or associated with the whistleblower may also apply for any other
right or remedy available to him under any other written law.

_Clause 17 seeks to empower the court to grant an injunction order against_
any person who takes detrimental action against a whistleblower or any person
related to or associated with the whistleblower.

_Clause 18 empowers the court to make orders against the person who takes_
detrimental action in reprisal of disclosure of improper conduct. The court may
also make orders to a public body or private body to take necessary measures
to remedy a whistleblower or any person related to or associated with the
whistleblower as a result of detrimental action. Such orders include an order
to permit the whistleblower or that person to return to his duties and an order
to take personnel action such as an appointment, promotion or reinstatement
to restore the whistleblower or that person to a position that he would have
been in but for the detrimental action.

_Clause 19 provides for the relocation of place of employment to the_
whistleblower or any person related to or associated with the whistleblower
by a request to the enforcement agency to make an application on his behalf
to the public body or private body for relocation of his place of employment
to prevent reprisal action being taken against him.

7. Part VI of this Bill contains provisions on enforcement, offences and
penalties.

investigation as provided for the enforcement agency under the relevant
laws.

for the whistleblower’s role in detecting cases on improper conduct or detrimental
action or prosecution of the person against whom the disclosure of improper

is to encourage more people who have information on improper conduct to
make disclosure to the enforcement agency to ensure that the improper conduct
will be investigated and acted upon accordingly.
