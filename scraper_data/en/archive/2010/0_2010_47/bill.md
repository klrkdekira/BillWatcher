you say, whether in answer to a question or not, may

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Renewable Energy Bill 2010 (“the proposed Act”) seeks to provide for
the establishment and implementation of a special tariff system to catalyse
the generation of renewable energy, and for related matters.

Part I

2. Part I deals with preliminary matters.

3. Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act. The proposed Act
applies throughout Malaysia. However, the Minister is empowered to appoint
different dates for the coming into operation of different provisions of the
Act in different parts of Malaysia.

4. Clause 2 contains the definitions of certain words and expressions used
in the proposed Act.

Part II

5. Part II provides for the establishment of the feed-in tariff system and for
related matters.

6. Clause 3 seeks to establish the feed-in tariff system which provides
for the connection to supply line connection points for the distribution of
renewable energy generated from renewable energy installations owned by
feed-in approval holders and the priority of the purchase and distribution
by distribution licensees for renewable energy generated and sold by such
renewable energy installations. The system also provides for the feed-in tariff
to be paid to feed-in approval holders for such renewable energy. The feed-in
tariff system is to be administered and implemented by the Sustainable Energy
Development Authority of Malaysia (“the Authority”) which, in carrying out its
functions, will give due consideration to the matters specified in subclause 3(3).

7. _Clause 4 seeks to provide for the eligibility criteria for the application of_
the feed-in approval. A person is eligible to apply for the feed-in approval if
the person proposes to generate renewable energy from a renewable energy
installation having an installed capacity of not more than thirty megawatts or
such higher installed capacity as may be approved by the Minister and if the
person meets such other criteria as prescribed by the Authority.

8. _Clause 5 deals with applications for feed-in approvals under the proposed_
Act.

9. _Clause 6_ seeks to enable the Authority to require an eligible producer to
submit additional information or documents after receiving an application for
a feed-in approval from such eligible producer.

10. _Clause 7 seeks to empower the Authority to approve or refuse an application_

for a feed-in approval. A feed-in approval granted under this clause shall be
personal to a feed-in approval holder and cannot be assigned or transferred
to any person except with the prior written approval of the Authority.


-----

48 _Bill_

11. _Clause 8_ seeks to require the Authority to impose all the prescribed

standard conditions of a feed-in approval and to enable such special conditions
to be imposed as it thinks fit.

12. _Clause 9_ empowers the Authority to impose any additional conditions

on a feed-in approval or to vary or revoke any conditions imposed on a feedin approval. Before such a decision is made by the Authority, the feed-in
approval holder is to be given written notice of the Authority’s intention and
an opportunity to make written submissions.

13. _Clause 10_ seeks to empower the Authority to revoke a feed-in approval

in certain circumstances. Before such a decision is made by the Authority,
the feed-in approval holder is to be given written notice of the Authority’s
intention and an opportunity to make written submissions. Once the revocation
of a feed-in approval has taken effect, the feed-in approval holder will cease
to be entitled to participate in the feed-in tariff system and to receive feed-in
tariff payments.

14. _Clause 11_ seeks to allow any person who is aggrieved by the decision

of the Authority under _clauses 7, 9 and_ _10 to make an appeal to the Minister_
whose decision shall be final.

Part III

15. Part III deals with the renewable energy power purchase agreement, and

the connection to supply line connection points and priority of the purchase
and distribution by distribution licensees for renewable energy generated by
renewable energy installations.

16. _Clause 12 seeks to require a distribution licensee to enter into a renewable_

energy power purchase agreement with a feed-in approval holder within
such period and in the form as prescribed by the Authority. The distribution
licensee is not obliged to enter into the agreement if certain requirements are
met. A person who contravenes this clause commits an offence and shall, on
conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding one million ringgit.

17. _Clause 13 seeks to require a distribution licensee to connect a renewable_

energy installation owned by a feed-in approval holder to a supply line within
such period as prescribed by the Authority. A person who contravenes this
clause commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not
exceeding one million ringgit.

18. _Clause 14 seeks to require a distribution licensee, as a priority over_

the electricity generated from resources other than renewable resources, to
purchase and distribute through the supply line the entire available quantity
of renewable energy generated by a renewable energy installation owned by
a feed-in approval holder unless exempted by the Authority having regard
to public safety and private safety. A person who contravenes this clause
commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding
one million ringgit.

_Renewable Energy_ 49

19. _Clause 15 seeks to empower the Authority, with the concurrence of the_

Energy Commission, to prescribe rules governing technical and operational
requirements to be complied with by distribution licensees and feed-in approval
holders in the implementation of Part III of the proposed Act.

Part IV

20. Part IV deals with the provisions relating to the feed-in tariff to be paid

to feed-in approval holders, degression rates and review of feed-in tariff, and
grid parity of renewable energy installations.

21. _Clause 16 seeks to provide that a feed-in approval holder shall be paid_

a feed-in-tariff based on the applicable feed-in tariff rate as adjusted under
_clause 18_ for the renewable energy generated by his or its renewable energy
installation.

22. _Clause 17 seeks to provide for the progressive reduction of the feed-in_

tariff rate each year based on the applicable degression rate commencing on
1 January every year after the date of coming into operation of the proposed
Act. However, no further reduction shall be made to a feed-in tariff rate
applicable to a feed-in approval holder after the feed-in tariff commencement
date in respect of that feed-in approval holder.

23. _Clause 18 deals with the procedure of review and adjustment of degression_

rates for the purposes of improving the overall performance of the feed-in
tariff system to better achieve the objective of the proposed Act. The revised
degression rate shall not be applicable to the feed-in approval holders existing
before the revised degression rate comes into effect.

24. _Clause 19 seeks to allow a distribution licensee to recover from the Fund_

a sum equivalent to the difference between the amount of feed-in tariffs paid
by the distribution licensee to feed-in approval holders and the cost which
the distribution licensee would have otherwise had to incur to generate the
same amount of electricity generated by such feed-in approval holders based
on the prevailing displaced cost.

25. _Clause 20_ seeks to allow a distribution licensee and the Authority to be

paid administrative fees for administering the payment of the feed-in tariffs to
feed-in approval holders and for implementing and administering the feed-in
tariff system, respectively at the rate to be determined by the Minister.

26. _Clause 21 seeks to require the Authority to determine whether a particular_

renewable energy installation has achieved grid parity. Grid parity is achieved
where the feed-in tariff rate applicable to that renewable energy installation
is equal to or cheaper than the displaced cost. Upon notification of the
achievement of grid parity, a feed-in approval holder shall cease to be paid
the feed-in tariff and shall instead be paid by the distribution licensee a tariff
that is based on the prevailing displaced cost for the remaining duration of the
effective period and the distribution licensee shall not be entitled to recover
from the Fund the sums referred to in _clause 19 and be paid administrative_
fees under paragraph 20(a) in respect of that renewable energy installation.


-----

50 _Bill_

27. _Subclause 22(1) seeks to make it an offence for a person to dishonestly_

generate electricity from a renewable energy installation by using resources other
than the renewable resource specified in the feed-in approval applicable to that
renewable energy installation in order to receive the payment or higher payment
of feed-in tariffs. The person who commits this offence shall, on conviction,
be liable to a fine not exceeding one million ringgit or to imprisonment for
a term not exceeding five years or to both. _Subclause 22(3) empowers the_
Authority to require the person to pay for the loss to the Fund resulting from
the payment or higher payment of feed-in tariffs in _subclause 22(1) which if_
remains unpaid shall be treated as civil debt due to the Authority.

Part V

28. Part V provides for the establishment of the Renewable Energy Fund

and related matters.

29. _Clause 23_ seeks to establish the Renewable Energy Fund (“the Fund”)

which will be administered and controlled by the Authority.

30. _Subclause 24(1)_ seeks to empower the Minister to require a distribution

licensee to allocate and pay into the Fund a portion of tariffs levied by the
distribution licensee under subsection 26(1) of the Electricity Supply Act 1990.
A distribution licensee who contravenes _subclause 24(1) commits an offence_
and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding one million ringgit.
_Subclause 24(4) empowers the Authority to require the distribution licensee to_
pay into the Fund the unpaid portion of tariff which if remains unpaid shall be
treated as civil debt due to the Authority. _Subclause 24(6) seeks to allow the_
Minister to revoke the requirement in _subclause 24(1) if he is satisfied that_
there are sufficient moneys in the Fund to meet the purposes of the proposed
Act.

31. _Clause 25 sets out the expenditure that may be charged to the Fund._

32. _Clause 26_ requires the moneys from the Fund, in so far as they are not

required or immediately required to be expended by the Authority under the
proposed Act, to be invested in such manner as the Minister may approve
with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance.

33. _Clause 27_ requires the Authority to cause proper accounts of the Fund

and proper reports of its activities in respect of the Fund to be kept and to
submit the accounts and auditor’s report to the Minister who shall cause the
accounts and auditor’s report to be laid before both Houses of Parliament.
