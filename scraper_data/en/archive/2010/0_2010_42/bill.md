_Arbitration (Amendment)_ 5

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Arbitration Act 2005 (“Act 646”).

2. _Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title and the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to delete the reference to section 30 of Act 646 in paragraph_
2(2)(b) of Act 646 so as to bring section 30 within the ambit of paragraph
2(2)(b), thus allowing the parties to authorize a third party in relation to their
right under section 30.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 8 of Act 646 to adopt, with modification,_
the language used in the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985.
This provision is to limit court intervention to situations specifically covered
by Act 646 and to discourage the use of inherent powers.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend subsection 10(1) of Act 646 and to introduce_
new subsections (2a), (2b), (2c) and (4). Subsection 10(1) is amended to
delete unnecessary provision. The new subsections (2a) and (2b) empower
the court to order the retention of the property or provision of security
pending the determination of the arbitration proceedings related to admiralty
disputes. The new subsection (2c) is to provide for the definition of “admiralty
proceeding”. The new subsection (4) empowers the Malaysian court to grant
stay of proceedings if the seat of arbitration is outside Malaysia.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend paragraph 11(1)(e) of Act 646 to clarify that to_
secure the amount in dispute, the court may order the arrest of property, bail
or other security before or during arbitral proceedings. The new subsection
11(3) is inserted to empower the Malaysian court to make orders for any
interim measure even if the seat of arbitration is outside Malaysia.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 30 of Act 646 to allow parties to a_
domestic arbitration to determine the substantive law to be applicable but the
arbitral tribunal shall only apply the law of Malaysia in the absence of such
determination by the parties.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 38 of Act 646 to provide for the_
enforcement of any awards made in Malaysia be it in respect of domestic or
international arbitration.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 39 of Act 646 to provide that the_
determination of the validity of the arbitration agreement should be decided
under the laws of the State where the award was made and not necessarily
under the laws of Malaysia. The other amendment in clause 8 is to provide
for severability provision to be consistent with the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to amend section 42_ of Act 646 by inserting a new

subsection (1a) to allow the High Court to dismiss any reference on a question
of law unless the question of law substantially affects the rights of one or
more of the parties.


-----

6 _Bill_

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend subsection 51(2) of Act 646 in the national_

language text so as to be consistent with the English text. For the avoidance
of doubt, subsection 51(4) is introduced to clarify that any court proceeding
that was initiated after the commencement of Act 646 will be governed by
Act 646 notwithstanding that the arbitral proceeding was commenced before
the commencement of Act 646.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.

[PN(U[2])2645]
