EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (“Act 593”) with the
aim, among others, to overcome the backlog of cases pending in the criminal
courts and to promote the expeditious disposal of criminal cases.


-----

16 _Bill_

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to introduce a new Chapter_ XVIIIa into Part VI of Act
593. The new Chapter XVIIIa contains six new sections, namely sections
172a, 172b, 172c, 172d, 172e and 172f. This new Chapter deals with processes
before trial which seek to shorten the trial period and to expedite the disposal
of criminal trials.

The new section 172a deals with pre-trial conference. The section enables

the accused, who is represented by his advocate, and the Public Prosecutor
to iron out issues before the commencement of the case management process.
Under this system, the prosecution and the defence will be able to discuss
the merits of their respective cases and narrow down the issues of contention
or reach an agreement on plea bargaining even before the case management
process is held. The pre-trial conference is conducted in the absence of judicial
officers and may be conducted at any venue or by any means as may be agreed
upon by the advocate and the Public Prosecutor. The pre-trial conference can
be held in a less formal atmosphere with a view to formalize any outcome
during the case management process. At the end of the pre-trial conference,
all matters agreed upon shall be put in writing and signed by the accused,
his advocate and the Public Prosecutor.

The new section 172b seeks to enable the Court to commence a case

management process for a criminal case. A case management process must
be held within sixty days from the date the accused is charged. A subsequent
case management process, if necessary, can take place not less than two weeks
before the commencement of the trial. During the case management process,
the prosecution and the defence are required, among others, to present to the
Court any matter which they have considered and agreed upon during the pretrial conference. The Court then will fix a trial date and make any directions
that will promote a fair and expeditious trial. The Court shall commence the
trial not later than ninety days from the date of the accused being charged.
All matters agreed upon and reduced into writing as well as signed by the
accused, his advocate and the Public Prosecutor under section 172a will be
admissible as evidence at the trial.

Both the pre-trial conference and criminal case management process

complement the existing provisions in Act 593 with regard to the supplying
of documents which the prosecution wishes to give to the accused as well as
supplying to the accused facts favourable to the defence. These matters can
be sorted out by the parties in the pre-trial conference or the criminal case
management to ensure the smooth running of the trial if the parties cannot reach
a “satisfactory disposition of the case” in the process of plea bargaining.

The new sections 172c to 172f deal with plea bargaining.

Section 172c seeks to provide for the application process for plea bargaining.

The Court has a duty to ensure that the accused has made the application
for plea bargaining voluntarily. The Court also has a duty to ensure that the
process is done voluntarily between the Public Prosecutor and the accused.
Once the issue of voluntariness is settled, the accused and the Public Prosecutor


-----

_Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)_ 17

shall then proceed to mutually agree on a satisfactory disposition of the case.
Where the accused and the Public Prosecutor could not come to a satisfactory
disposition of the case, the case shall proceed to trial before another Court
so as not to prejudice the accused.

Section 172d deals with the disposal of the case by the Court. The Court

shall dispose the case by making orders under section 426 of Act 593, or
where the plea bargaining is in relation to the charge, find the accused guilty
of the agreed charge in the satisfactory disposition and sentence the accused
accordingly, or where the plea bargaining is in relation to the sentence, find
the accused guilty of the offence and sentence the accused under section 293 or
294 of Act 593 or sentence the accused to not more than half of the maximum
punishment under the law for the offence. When there is a minimum term of
imprisonment, the sentence should not be lower than that of the minimum
term. There is thus a mechanism of inducement for the accused to plead guilty
and at the same time know with greater predictability the sentencing range.

Section 172e provides that the judgment of the Court under section 172d

shall be not appealable except to the extent and legality of the sentence.

Section 172f seeks to protect the accused by prohibiting any statement

made or fact stated by the accused during plea bargaining to be use for any
other purpose.

4. Clauses 3 and 4 seek to amend sections 173 and 176 of Act 593 respectively,
while _clause 5_ seeks to introduce a new section, namely section 183a, into
Act 593. The amendments seek to enable the Court to consider a statement
made by the victim of an offence or a member of his family on the impact
of the offence committed against the victim before the Court passes sentence.
The amendments to sections 173 and 176 are in relation to trials before the
lower courts while section 183a is in relation to trials before the High Court.
The object of these amendments is to recognise the rights of the victims
of crime. The victim impact statement provides the Court with information
about the effect of the offence upon the victim or his family. The criminal
justice process must be fair to both victims and offenders. By having the
Courts consider victim impact statements before passing sentence, the balance
between the offender and the victim in the criminal justice system (that is
often offender-oriented) is restored.

5. Clause 6 seeks to introduce a new section, namely section 254a, into
Act 593. This new section deals with the trial of an accused who has been
given a discharge and subsequently is recharged for the same offence. If
witnesses have been called to give evidence in the trial before the discharge
was given, the trial shall be reinstated and be continued as if there had been
no discharge given to the accused. As there is no necessity to start the trial
afresh, the trial period can be shortened and the disposal of the case will be
expedited.

6. Clause 7 seeks to amend section 402a of Act 593. With this amendment,
if the accused seeks to put forward a defence of alibi, he is no longer required
to give the Public Prosecutor a notice in writing at least ten days before the
commencement of the trial. Under the proposed amendment, the accused will


-----

18 _Bill_

be informed by the Court about the defence of alibi when he is charged. The
accused is then required to put forward his defence of alibi, if any, during
the case management process. The early notice to the Public Prosecutor of the
defence of alibi will allow the Public Prosecutor to investigate such defence
before the commencement of the trial, and thus, avoid unnecessary delays
during the trial itself.

However, should the accused fail to put forward his defence of alibi during

the case management process, he could still put forward the defence of alibi
at any stage of the trial subject to the Public Prosecutor being notified of the
alibi and given a reasonable time to investigate such a defence. This amendment
gives the accused a more favourable position than the existing provision.

7. Clause 8 seeks to introduce two new sections, namely sections 402b and
402c, into Act 593. The new section 402b seeks to facilitate the substitution
of oral evidence with that of written statements. This process will enable
the Public Prosecutor and the defence to tender statements in the form of
evidence during examination-in-chief. This will save the Court’s time in
recording evidence as the statements will have effect as though the evidence
were oral evidence given in open court and any exhibits tendered by virtue of
this section is tendered as though tendered in the normal course of trial. The
new section 402c is another time saving provision. This provision is in fact
complementary to the new section 402b. It states that any party may admit
to any fact of which oral evidence may be given and the admission of such
fact by either party of any such fact is conclusive in those proceedings of
the fact admitted. This would enable parties to agree on certain facts so that
there can be a narrowing down of the issues.

8. Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new section, namely section 407a, into Act
593. This new section makes provision for the early disposal of certain seized
articles which, having regard to the nature of the articles, are dangerous,
difficult, expensive and highly inconvenient to be kept in the custody of the
police. If the circumstances requires for the disposal of the seized articles, the
Public Prosecutor may apply to the Court for a disposal order. The Court shall
make an order for the disposal subject to certain procedures being complied
with. There shall be a complete and detailed inventory and photographs of the
articles to be disposed. Representative samples of the articles would be taken
and kept and a Magistrate or Judge having the trial jurisdiction shall issue a
certificate of the correctness of the inventory, photographs and representative
samples. The procedures are mandatory to be complied with so as to ascertain
that the chain of evidence is maintained.

With this provision, the police will be able to reduce the risks faced by

them and the public by the keeping of highly hazardous and dangerous seized
articles at their storage premises. Other than that, early disposal of the seized
articles would also reduce the high cost incurred in maintaining and storing
the seized articles and overcome the problems of limited storage space.

9. Clause 10 seeks to amend section 413 of Act 593. This amendment seeks
to provide that any property seized shall be detained if the property is still
required for investigation purposes, and the property shall be kept in a safe and
proper place by the Officer in charge of a Police District where the offence
was committed.

seeks to make it mandatory for the Court, upon an application of the Public
Prosecutor, to make an order for the convicted accused to pay compensation
to the victim of the offence committed by the said accused. The Court shall

of compensation. The amendment also empowers the Court to hold an inquiry
if it thinks fit to do so. With this amendment, reparation may be made to a
victim of an offence by the person who actually had adversely affected the
victim through his unlawful act.

expenditure.
