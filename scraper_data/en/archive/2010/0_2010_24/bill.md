EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Employment Act 1955 (“Act 265”). The
primary purpose of this Bill is to require the payment of wages of domestic
servants to be made into bank accounts of the domestic servants, to provide
for the registration of information relating to the supply of employees by a
contractor for labour, to require a notice and return of particulars relating to
the employment of foreign employees to be submitted and to provide for the
establishment of procedure for dealing with complaints of sexual harassment
and inquiry into such complaints.

2. Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint
the commencement date of the proposed Act.


-----

_Employment (Amendment)_ 15

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 265 to introduce new definitions_
and to amend certain existing definitions used in Act 265. The definition of
“confinement” is amended to enable a pregnant female employee to enjoy
maternity protections under Act 265 as early as at twenty-two weeks of
pregnancy should the eventualities such as premature births or miscarriages
occur. Amongst the new definitions inserted are the definitions of contractor
for labour as the person responsible for supply of employees and the definition
of sexual harassment for the purpose of the establishment of procedure for
dealing with complaints of sexual harassment in the new Part XVA of Act 265.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 4 of Act 265 to include the decisions or
orders made under sections 69B and 69C as decisions or orders which cannot
be appealed to the Director General by any person affected by such decisions
and orders.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 25A of Act 265 to extend the application_
of the section. With the amendment, the wages of employees can be paid
into their bank accounts in any licensed financial institution or institutions
approved by Bank Negara Malaysia other than a bank or finance company
licensed under the Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 [Act 372].

6. _Clause 6_ seeks to introduce a new section 25B into Act 265 to require
the employers of domestic servants to pay the wages directly into the bank
accounts of their domestic servants unless exempted by the Director General
in writing.

7. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new section 33A into Act 265 to impose a_
duty on the contractor for labour to register with the Director General in the
prescribed form if he intends to supply or undertakes to supply any employee.
It also requires a contractor for labour who supplies any employee to keep or
maintain information on the employees he supplies in a register and the register
shall be made available for inspection. Violations of these requirements are
offences under Act 265. The purpose of the introduction of this new section
is to monitor the supply of employees by the contractor for labour.

8. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 37 to penalize employers who terminate_
the service of a female employee during the period in which she is entitled to
maternity leave provided that the termination is not due to retirement, resignation
tendered by such employee or the closure of the employer’s business.

9. _Clause 11 seeks to amend subsection 40(3) of Act 265 to clarify that no_
service of a female employee shall be terminated during the period in which
she is entitled to maternity leave even though she fails to give notice of her
maternity leave as required under subsections 40(1) and (2).

10. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 42 of Act 265 for purpose of_
clarification.

payment of wages to employees who are paid on a weekly basis for working
on a rest day.


-----

16 _Bill_

12. _Clause 14 seeks to amend section 60D of Act 265 to include Malaysia_
Day which falls on 16 September every year as a mandatory gazetted public
holiday on which an employee shall be entitled to a paid holiday at his ordinary
rate of pay.

13. _Clause 15 seeks to amend section 60I of Act 265 to extend the calculation_
of the ordinary rate of pay to employees employed on an hourly rate of
pay.

14. _Clause 16 seeks to amend section 60K of Act 265 to impose a duty on_
an employer to give notice of his intention to employ foreign employees in
the prescribed form to the Director General before employing the foreign
employees, and also to furnish further information and particulars regarding
the notice to the Director General. The Director General may require an
employer to furnish returns of particulars relating to the employment of a
foreign employee in such manner as the Director General may direct. Such
notice and returns of particulars would assist the Government in monitoring
the employment of foreign employees. The proposed amendment would also
enable the Labour Department to address the concern over the employment
of local job seekers.

15. _Clause 17 seeks to amend section 60O of Act 265 to redefine the term of_
“foreign employee” to exclude domestic servants from the provisions of Part
XIIB. This would mean that the requirement for the submission of notice of
intention to employ foreign employees to the Director General under section
60K shall not apply in employing domestic servants.

16. _Clause 21 seeks to introduce a new Part XVA into Act 265 which deals_
with complaints of sexual harassment. Section 81A clarifies the meaning of the
term “complaint of sexual harassment”. Section 81B imposes upon an employer
to establish procedure for dealing with complaints of sexual harassment and
to inquire into complaints of sexual harassment in a manner prescribed by
the Minister. Section 81C deals with findings of the inquiry into complaints
of sexual harassment by the employer. Section 81D deals with complaints of
sexual harassment which are made directly to the Director General and his
findings of the complaints. By virtue of section 81E, if a complaint of sexual
harassment is made against an employer who is a sole proprietor, the Director
General shall inquire into the complaint himself in a manner prescribed by
the Minister. Section 81F deals with offences under this Part whilst section
81G provides that this Part shall apply to all employees irrespective of their
wages.

17. _Clause 22 seeks to amend section 82 of Act 265 to be in line with the_
provisions under the Criminal Procedure Code with regards to the service of
summons.

18. _Clause 23 seeks to amend section 86 of Act 265 consequential upon the_
proposed amendment made to section 4.

19. _Clause 24 seeks to introduce a new section 90A into Act 265 to provide_
for the protection of officers appointed under this Act from any legal action
while carrying out their duties.


-----

_Employment (Amendment)_ 17

20. _Clause 25 seeks to amend section 92 of Act 265 to make it an offence if_
an employer fails to pay the wages of his domestic servant into the domestic
servant’s bank account without an exemption in writing from the Director
General.

21. _Clause 26 seeks to amend section 101A of Act 265 to empower officers_
other than the Director General and the Deputy Director General to compound
any offence committed under this Act, provided that they are authorized in
writing by the Director General to do so.

22. _Clause 27 seeks to introduce a new section 101B into Act 265 to make_
directors, managers, partners and trade union office-bearers to be jointly or
severally liable for any offences committed by their establishment.

23. _Clause 28 seeks to amend section 102 of Act 265 to empower the_
Minister to make regulations prescribing for matters relating to the employment
of foreign employees specifically under section 60K, matters relating to the
establishment of procedure for dealing with complaints of sexual harassment
and the procedure to inquire into such complaints, and terms and conditions
of service of a domestic servant.

24. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
