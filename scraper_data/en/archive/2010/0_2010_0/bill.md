EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Educational Institutions (Discipline) Act 1976
(“Act 174”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the power of the Minister to appoint_
the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 174 to introduce new definitions
and to amend existing definitions used in Act 174.

The definition of “Disciplinary Committee” is deleted consequential upon
the deletion of section 4 in _clause 3._

The definition of “Minister” is substituted as reference is also made to
the Minister responsible for Higher Education for certain Institutions under
Act 174.

A new definition of “registrable offence” is essentially intended to replace
the words “criminal offence” used in Act 174.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to delete section 4 of Act 174 on discipline of the staff
of an Institution. The provision has outlived its usefulness as matters relating
to discipline of the staff of the Universiti Teknologi MARA, which is a
body corporate, are presently regulated by the Statutory Bodies (Discipline
and Surcharge) Act 2000 [Act 605] whilst the staff of the other Institutions
as specified in the First Schedule of Act 174 who are public servants are
governed by the Public Officers (Conduct and Discipline) Regulations 1993

[P.U. (A) 395/1993].

5. Clause 4 seeks to amend section 5 of the Act 174 to improve procedural
safeguards for students in disciplinary proceedings.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to substitute section 9 of Act 174 to give the SRC,_
organization, body or group of students of an Institution the right to make a
written representation before any suspension or dissolution is made against it
by the Executive Head. It also creates a right of appeal to the Minister.


-----

12 _Bill_

7. _Clause 6_ seeks to substitute section 10 of Act 174 to confer on students
and student organizations freedom of association subject to restrictions in
relation to political parties, unlawful organizations and organizations, body
or group of persons identified by the Minister as unsuitable to the interest
and well-being of the students or student bodies. In addition to that, the
Executive Head may, on the application of a student, exempt the student
from the restrictions mentioned in the proposed paragraph (1)(a). This will
enable a serving politician from any political party to enroll as a student of an
Institution without giving up his political career. The proposed subsection (6)
seeks to expand the scope of freedom of speech and expression on academic
matters by a student. The proposed subsection (7) seeks to remove the criminal
penalties provided under this section and to substitute them with disciplinary
action. Decriminalization proposed in this section is in line with the spirit
prevailing in laws which govern higher education.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to amend section 11 of Act 174. The criminal penalty in_
subsection (2) is substituted with disciplinary action and in order to provide
autonomy to an Institution, the power to grant exemption under subsection (3)
is now given to the Executive Head.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to substitute section 12 of Act 174 to provide that if_
a registrable offence has been committed in the name or on behalf of any
organization, body or group of students of an Institution, any student convicted
of such offence shall be liable to disciplinary action whilst the organization,
body or group of students shall be liable to suspension or dissolution.

10. The substitution of criminal offence with disciplinary offence in the
proposed Act renders section 13 of Act 174 no longer of any use and hence
is deleted in _clause 9._

11. _Clause 10_ seeks to replace section 14 of Act 174. The new section 14
proposes reliefs to students facing criminal charges, detention, restriction order
or imprisonment. Subsection (1) seeks to confer discretion on the Executive
Head to decide whether or not to suspend a student who is charged with a
registrable offence. Subsections (2) and (3) render a student who is convicted
of a registrable offence, or detained or subjected to an order of restriction
under any written law relating to preventive detention or internal security,
liable to disciplinary action instead of him immediately ceasing to be a student
under such circumstances by virtue of the existing provisions. Subsection (4)
seeks to allow a student who is placed under detention or subjected to an
order imposing restriction on him or who is being imprisoned to sit for his
examination if consented to by the Executive Head and subject to an order
being made or approval given by the Minister responsible for internal security
or any competent authority, as the case may require. Subsections (5) and (6)
seek to respectively allow a student who is suspended from an Institution or a
student who ceases to be a student of the Institution under Act 174 to pursue
his studies at any other Institution or University with the written approval of
the Minister. These amendments are in line with the right to education for all.
Subsections (7) and (8) seek to provide that the period of suspension, detention
or restriction shall not be considered in calculating the maximum duration
permitted to complete the course of study and in the computation of his result
where a student is discharged or acquitted of a registrable offence or released
from detention or restrictions imposed on him revoked.


-----

_Educational Institutions (Discipline) (Amendment)_ 13

12. The proposed deletion of sections 15 and 16 in _clauses 11 and_ _12_
respectively are consequential amendments occasioned by the move to subject
students now to disciplinary action with certain procedural safeguards for any
alleged misconduct.

13. _Clause 14 deals with saving and transitional provisions._

14. Other amendments not specifically referred to in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.

[PN(U[2])2644]
