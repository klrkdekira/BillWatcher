EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Tourism Vehicles Licensing Act 1999 (“Act 594”)
as a consequence of the enactment of the Suruhanjaya Pengangkutan Awam
Darat Act 2010 and the Land Public Transport Act 2010. The Suruhanjaya
Pengangkutan Awam Darat Act 2010 seeks to establish the Suruhanjaya
Pengangkutan Awam Darat (“Commission”) as the principal regulator for
land public transport, including tourism vehicles, for Peninsular Malaysia.
The Land Public Transport Act 2010 provides the regulatory framework for
land public transport in Peninsular Malaysia. With the coming into operation
of the Suruhanjaya Pengangkutan Awam Darat Act 2010 and the Land Public
Transport Act 2010, Act 594 will only apply to Sabah, Sarawak and the
Federal Territory of Labuan.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and enables the Minister to appoint the_
commencement date of this Bill.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to define “appointed date”._


-----

4 _Bill_

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 1 of Act 594 to clarify that Act 594 will_
only apply to Sabah, Sarawak, and the Federal Territory of Labuan.

5. _Clause 4 provides for the non-application, transitional and saving_
provision.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.

[PN(U[2])2737]
