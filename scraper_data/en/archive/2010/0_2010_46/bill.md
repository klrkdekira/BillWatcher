This Bill seeks to amend the Copyright Act 1987 (“Act 332”).

artistic works, musical works, sound recordings, films, broadcasts and protection
for performers. The proposed amendments include provisions to fulfill the
requirements for accession to the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and WIPO
Phonograms and Performances Treaty (WPPT). The proposed amendments

new developments and new international standards.

3. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of_
the proposed Bill.

4. _Clause 2 seeks to delete the word “live” from the term “live performance”_

that is performed live. This proposed amendment is also consistent with Article 2
of the WPPT.


-----

36 _Bill_

5. _Clause 3 seeks to further clarify certain words which are defined in section 3,_
such as the definition of “fixation” and “literary work”. The amendment to the
definition of “literary work” is also to be in line with the definition which is
applied in the Berne Convention. The term “technological protection measure”
is introduced to support the new provision made in _clause 26 on offences_
relating to technological protection measure.

6. _Clause 4_ seeks to amend paragraph 4(1)(d) to clarify that a performance
has to be in a fixed form in order to amount to publication.

7. _Clause 5 seeks to amend subsection 5(2) to confer the power to appoint the_
Deputy Controllers, Assistant Controllers and any other officers to administer
the Act on the Minister. It also seeks to empower the Controller and Deputy
Controllers to exercise all the powers of an Assistant Controller as provided
under the Act.

8. _Clause 6_ seeks to delete subsection 7(6) with regard to the exploitation
of design of artistic works, thus allowing the copyright owner to enjoy the
protection provided under this Act for the duration of 25 years from the date
it was first marketed, which is the date the product was first actually delivered
pursuant to orders received.

9. _Clause 7 seeks to amend paragraph 8(b)_ to extend copyright protection
to compilation of database which, by virtue of its arrangement, constitutes an
intellectual creation.

10. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 9 by expanding the purposes in which_

a reproduction of typographical arrangement of a published edition does not
infringe copyright for as long as the reproduction is compatible with the
concept of fair dealing.

the WCT on rights of commercial rental for films to the author in the event the

paragraph (a) for the purpose of research, private study and reporting of current
event. The amendment to paragraph _(gggg) is to enable the modification of_
works into a format for persons with vision impairment or is physically or
mentally handicapped. The amendment to paragraph (j) is to expand the right
of reproduction of any work via broadcasting to all broadcasters other than
broadcast owned by the Government. The inclusion of a new paragraph _(q)_
is to accommodate fair usage through internet.

12. _Clause 10_ is a consequence of the amendment made in _clause 6._

13. _Clause 11 seeks to delete section 13c which is no longer applicable in_

Malaysia.

14. _Clause 12 seeks to amend subsection 16a(1) to be consistent with the_

requirements of Article 15 of WPPT in relation to the rights on reproduction of
a fixed performance. Clause 12 also seek to expand the element of exceptions
and limitations to the exclusive rights of the performer in paragraph 16a(3)(b)

such proceedings or for the purpose of the giving of professional advice by
a legal practitioner.

in Article 17 of the WPPT in providing clarification on the calculation of the
protection period for fixed performances.

17. _Clause 16 seeks to introduce new sections 26a, 26b and 26c to provide_

for new provisions relating to voluntary notification mechanism of copyright
works. The notification is on a voluntary basis and does not impede the
requirement of non-formality for the enjoyment and exercise of the copyright
protection under the Berne Convention. The certificate of notification issued
by the Controller shall be _prima facie evidence of the particulars relating to_
the copyright as stated in the Register of Copyright.

18. _Clause 17 seeks to introduce a new section on the declaration of a_

society or organization as a licensing body. Thus, only a fit and proper body

respectively in relation to the operation of licensing schemes. This amendment

on licensing scheme to the Tribunal.

20. _Clause 21_ and 22 seek to amend sections 28 and 29 in relation to the

Tribunal by setting out the powers of the Tribunal clearly and to increase the
number of Deputy Chairman from one to five and to reduce the number of
members from not less than twenty to twelve. This is to cater for the need
to convene simultaneous multiple proceedings.

a member of the Tribunal to act as chairman of the Tribunal’s proceeding in
circumstances where the Chairman is not able to chair a proceeding.

22. _Clause 24 seeks to amend section 31 to allow application for compulsory_

licence to produce and publish a translation of literary works into other

prohibition of the act of circumventing technological protection measure and
section 36b provides for the prohibition of removing or altering electronic
rights management information.

25. _Clause 27 seeks_ to amend section 37 to provide for statutory damages as

a relief in civil claims for infringement of copyrights as well as the prohibited

on the liabilities of the internet service providers.
