EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Income Tax Act 1967 (“Act 53”), the Stamp
Act 1949 (“Act 378”), the Petroleum (Income Tax) Act 1967 (“Act 543”), the
Real Property Gains Tax Act 1976 (“Act 169”), the Finance Act 2007 (“Act
683”) and the Finance Act 2009 (“Act 693”).

1. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 53 on the definition of “foreign_
tax” to provide that for the purposes of double taxation arrangements and tax
information exchange arrangements, the meaning of “foreign tax” is extended
to taxes of every kind under the laws of the territory outside Malaysia.

This amendment commences on the coming into operation of this Act.

The clause further seeks to introduce a new definition of “Labuan business

activity” into Act 53 as a consequence of the amendments to the Labuan Business
Activity Tax Act 1990 [Act 445] and the definition of “Labuan company” to


-----

_Finance (No. 2)_ 19

cover only Labuan companies incorporated under the Labuan Companies Act
1990 [Act 441] and includes a foreign Labuan company registered under the
Labuan Companies Act 1990, Labuan partnership, Labuan trust and Malaysian
bank as defined under the Labuan Financial Services and Securities Act 2010

[Act 704] for the purpose of Act 53.

The _clause seeks to insert a new subsection 2(10) into Act 53 to provide_

that any reference to “Labuan Offshore Business Activity Tax Act 1990”,
“Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority”, “offshore business activity”,
“Offshore Companies Act 1990” and “offshore company” shall be construed
as “Labuan Business Activity Tax Act 1990”, “Labuan Financial Services
Authority”, “Labuan business activity”, “Labuan Companies Act 1990” and
“Labuan company” respectively as a consequence of the amendments to those
Acts.

This amendment is deemed to have come into operation on 11 February 2010.

2. _Clause 5 seeks to delete section 6c of Act 53. Prior to the amendment,_
an individual is entitled to a rebate on fees paid to the Government with
regard to the issuance of Employment Pass, Visit Pass or Work Pass. As the
responsibility for the payment of that fee is now borne by the employers such
rebate is no longer applicable to that individual.

This amendment has effect for the year of assessment 2011 and subsequent

years of assessment.

3. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 16 of Act 53 to provide that any pension
or other periodical payment received by a widower of a deceased employee is
deemed to be the source of income of that widower. Consequential amendment
is also made to paragraph 39(1)(d) in _clause 9._

This amendment has effect for the year of assessment 2011 and subsequent

years of assessment.

4. _Clause 7 seeks to amend paragraph 34(6)(k) of Act 53 as a consequence_
of the change of name of the Ministry responsible for the approval of arts,
cultural or heritage activities.

This amendment is deemed to have come into operation on 9 April 2009.
