small nylon cord tied so that it will tighten as the animal pulls

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Wildlife Conservation Bill 2010 (“the proposed Act”) seeks to provide for
the protection and conservation of wildlife, the licensing of certain activities
in respect of certain wildlife and for matters connected therewith.

The Protection of Wildlife Act 1972 [Act 76] is the main law which regulates
wildlife in this country. After 33 years, there is a need to revamp Act 76 to
streamline it with the current situation. Wildlife problems, such as illegal poaching


-----

134 _Bill_

and smuggling need to be addressed, and the penalties provided for offences
relating to wildlife which are relatively low now need to be increased. Another
matter which needs to be addressed is the lack of enforcement powers.

The proposed Act therefore seeks to improve the provisions of Act 76. In
this proposed Act, provisions relating to the licensing of activities concerning
wildlife have been refined. This proposed Act also provides greater protection
to wildlife by increasing the penalties for offences and giving extensive
enforcement powers to the enforcement officers.
