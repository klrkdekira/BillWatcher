**24B.** Without prejudice to the provisions in the Contracts
Act 1950, the Specific Relief Act 1950 [Act 137], the Sale
of Goods Act 1957 [Act 382] and the provisions of any other
law for the time being in force, the provisions of this Part
shall apply to all contracts.

**General procedural unfairness**

**24C.** (1) A contract or a term of a contract is procedurally
unfair if it has resulted in an unjust advantage to the supplier or
unjust disadvantage to the consumer on account of the conduct
of the supplier or the manner in which or circumstances under
which the contract or the term of the contract has been entered
into or has been arrived at by the consumer and supplier.

(2) For the purposes of this section, a court or the Tribunal
may take into account the following circumstances:

_(a) the knowledge and understanding of the consumer in_

relation to the meaning of the terms of the contract
or their effect;

_(b) the bargaining strength of the parties to the contract_

relative to each other;

_(c) reasonable standards of fair dealing;_

_(d) whether or not, prior to or at the time of entering_

into the contract, the terms of the contract were
subject to negotiation or were part of a standard
form contract;

_(e) whether or not it was reasonably practicable for the_

consumer to negotiate for the alteration of the contract
or a term of the contract or to reject the contract or
a term of the contract;

_(f) whether expressions contained in the contract are in_

fine print or are difficult to read or understand;


-----

_Consumer Protection (Amendment)_ 5

_(g) whether or not, even if the consumer had the competency_

to enter into the contract based on his or her capacity
and soundness of mind, the consumer—

(i) was not reasonably able to protect his or her own

interests or of those whom he or she represented
at the time the contract was entered; or

(ii) suffered serious disadvantages in relation to

other parties because the consumer was unable
to appreciate adequately the contract or a term
of the contract or its implications by reason of
age, sickness, or physical, mental, educational
or linguistic disability, or emotional distress or
ignorance of business affairs;

_(h) whether or not independent legal or other expert advice_

was obtained by the consumer who entered into the
contract;

_(i) the extent, if any, to which the provisions of the contract_

or a term of the contract or its legal or practical
effect was accurately explained by any person to the
consumer who entered into the contract;

_(j) the conduct of the parties who entered into the contract_

in relation to similar contracts or courses of dealing
between them; and

_(k) whether the consumer relied on the skill, care or_

advice of the supplier or a person connected with
the supplier in entering into the contract.

**General substantive unfairness**

**24D.** (1) A contract or a term of a contract is substantively
unfair if the contract or the term of the contract—

_(a) is in itself harsh;_

_(b) is oppressive;_

_(c) is unconscionable;_


-----

_Bill_

_(d) excludes or restricts liability for negligence; or_

_(e) excludes or restricts liability for breach of express_

or implied terms of the contract without adequate
justification.

(2) For the purposes of this section, a court or the Tribunal
may take into account the following circumstances:

_(a) whether or not the contract or a term of the contract_

imposes conditions—

(i) which are unreasonably difficult to comply with;

or

(ii) which are not reasonably necessary for the

protection of the legitimate interests of the
supplier who is a party to the contract;

_(b) whether the contract is oral or wholly or partly in_

writing;

_(c) whether the contract is in standard form;_

_(d) whether the contract or a term of the contract is_

contrary to reasonable standards of fair dealing;

_(e) whether the contract or a term of the contract has_

resulted in a substantially unequal exchange of
monetary values or in a substantive imbalance between
the parties;

_(f) whether the benefits to be received by the consumer who_

entered into the contract are manifestly disproportionate
or inappropriate, to his or her circumstances;

_(g) whether the consumer who entered into the contract_

was in a fiduciary relationship with the supplier;
and

_(h) whether the contract or a term of the contract—_

(i) requires manifestly excessive security for the

performance of contractual obligations;

(ii) imposes penalties which are disproportionate to

the consequences of a breach of contract;

_Consumer Protection (Amendment)_ 7

(iii) denies or penalizes the early repayment of

debts;

(iv) entitles the supplier to terminate the contract

unilaterally without good reason or without
paying reasonable compensation; or

(v) entitles the supplier to modify the terms of the

contract unilaterally.

**Burden of proof**

**24E.** If a contract or a term of a contract excludes or restricts
liability, or excludes rights, duties and liabilities, it is for the
supplier relying on such exclusion or restriction to prove that
it is not without adequate justification.

**Power to raise an issue of unfairness**

**24F.** A court or the Tribunal may, in proceedings before it,
raise an issue as to whether a contract or its terms are unfair
under sections 24C and 24D, even if none of the parties has
raised the issue in its pleadings.

**Effect of unfair terms**

**24G.** (1) In this Part, where a court or the Tribunal comes to
the conclusion, having regard to sections 24C and 24D that
a contract or a term of a contract is either procedurally or
substantively unfair or both, the court or the Tribunal may
declare the contract or the term of the contract as unenforceable
or void and the court may grant judgment, and the Tribunal
may make an award as provided for under section 112 of
this Act.

(2) A court or the Tribunal may determine if any of the terms
of the contract which are either procedurally or substantially
unfair, or both, are severable, and whether and to what extent
and in what manner, the remaining terms of the contract can
be enforced or given effect to.

**Executed contracts**

**24H.** A court may grant judgment, and the Tribunal may
make an award as provided for under section 112 of this
Act, notwithstanding that the contract has been wholly or
partly executed and for that purpose the court or Tribunal
may consider—

_(a) whether and to what extent restitution is possible in_

the facts and circumstances of the case; and

_(b) where such restitution is not possible, either wholly_

or partly, whether any compensation is payable.

**Contravention of Part IIIA to be an offence**

of this Part commits an offence and shall on conviction be
liable—

_(a)_ if such person is a body corporate, to a fine not

exceeding two hundred and fifty thousand ringgit,

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Consumer Protection Act 1999 (“Act 599”).

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provision on the commencement of

the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 9 of Act 599 to extend the protection_
of consumers to cover also misleading conduct of the availability of certain
services.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 21 of Act 599. The proposed amendment_

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 23 of Act 599 to provide for prohibition_
on and orders against unsafe services in addition to unsafe goods.

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to introduce a new Part IIIa which sets out provisions
on unfair contract terms in a consumer’s standard form contract. This new
Part seeks to give better protection to consumers in situations where unequal
bargaining powers between consumers and suppliers exist, which leaves
consumers with no option except to abide by the unfair terms. Among the
proposed provisions are provision which deal with procedural and substantive
unfairness, provision on the effect of unfair terms, provision on burden of
proof and provision on executed contracts.

and monitors advertisements which violate or fail to conform with Act 599.
A new Schedule is introduced in _clause 11 which shall apply to members of_
the Committee on Advertisement.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 98 of Act 599 by widening the jurisdiction_
of the Tribunal for Consumer Claims to hear claims where no redress mechanism
is provided for under any other law.

10. _Clause 9_ seeks to delete section 103, the provisions of which are now
provided for in the new subsection 98(1) as introduced in _clause 8._
