EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Human Rights Commission of

Malaysia Act 1999 (“Act 597”) to make the process of appointment

of the members of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia

(“Commission”) more transparent.

2. To that end, section 5 of Act 597 is proposed to be amended

in _clause 2 of the Bill. With the proposed amendment, the Prime_

Minister is required to consult the committee referred to in section

11A as proposed by this Bill before tendering his advice to the Yang

di-Pertuan Agong.

The amendment in _clause 2 also seeks to provide that_

members of the Commission must be men and women of various

religious, political and racial backgrounds and have knowledge of,

or practical experience in, matters relating to human rights. In

addition, members are to hold office for three years instead of two

years presently.

The proposed amendment also seeks to allow the Prime

Minister to determine suitable mechanisms to assess the


-----

performance of the members which must be taken into

consideration in their reappointment under subsection 5(4) and their

removal under section 10 of Act 597.

3. _Clause 3 seeks to provide for the establishment of a_

committee that will be consulted by the Prime Minister with regard to

the appointment of members of the Commission under subsection

5(2) as proposed by this Bill.

The committee shall consist of the Chief Secretary to the

Government who shall be the Chairman, the Chairman of the

Commission and three other persons of eminence appointed by the

Prime Minister. The eminent persons may include former judges

and former members of the Commission. However, no person who

is actively involved in politics and registered with any political party,

and is or was an enforcement officer shall be appointed to be

members of the committee.

The members of the committee shall serve the committee

according to such period and on such terms and conditions as

specified in their instruments of appointment.

The amendment in _clause 3 also seeks to provide that any_

opinion, view or recommendation of the committee upon

consultation by the Prime Minister shall not be binding on the Prime

Minister.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to provide for savings and transitional_

provisions. A member of the Commission who was appointed or

reappointed before the coming into operation of the amendment


-----

proposed by this Bill may continue to hold office for the remainder of

his term of office.

For the purpose of reappointment, a serving member of the

Commission at the time of the coming into operation of the

amendment proposed by this Bill is eligible to be reappointed if,

before the coming into operation of the amendment proposed by

this Bill, he has never been reappointed.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial

expenditure.
