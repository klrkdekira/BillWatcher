any case in which either—

_(a) the office of director rules make no provision in that_
case; or

_(b) the rules make provision but the trustee concludes in_
good faith that it would be impossible, unlawful,
impracticable, or plainly inconsistent with the wishes
of the settlor, to ensure compliance with the rules
in that case.

(9) A trustee shall have no duty—

_(a) to act pursuant to subsection (3) unless and until it_
receives actual notice that circumstances requiring
such action have arisen; or

_(b) to enquire as to whether circumstances requiring_
action pursuant to subsection (3) exist.

(10) Where, on any question concerning the appointment
of a director, a trustee makes an application to the Court
under section 49, the Court, in giving its directions, shall not
seek to reduce business risk, except to the extent, if at all,
that the Court concludes that a reduction would be consistent
with the wishes of the settlor.

the following:

_(a) making or procuring changes in the directorship of_
the company in accordance with the provisions of

(5) After acting pursuant to subsection (3), or after deciding
not to act, the trustee’s obligation to intervene shall be at an

(6) It shall be a ground for declining to act on an intervention
call if, apart from any other reason for declining, the call
is made on substantially similar ground that has been made
previously, and there appears to the trustee to be no reason to
alter, or act further on, the decision previously taken by it.

(7) Where a trust instrument specifies one or more
permitted grounds for complaint, the following provisions
shall apply:

_(a) an interested person may request the trustee to_
provide such information concerning the affairs
of the company and any connected company as

this purpose, procure the replacement of any of the
directors with the trustee’s own representative;

_(b) where there is an appointed enquirer he shall be_
under the following duties:

interest in some or all of the designated shares or
their proceeds or is the parent or legal guardian of
such a person.

(8) All expenses incurred in dealing with an intervention
call or considering the complaint on which it is based,
including trustee remuneration where applicable, and the cost
of any advice, shall be payable out of the trust fund and its
income in such proportions as the trustee decides, and if there

to the company, to make up the shortfall out of dividends
from the company and may, if considered necessary for this
purpose, procure the replacement of any of the directors with
the trustee’s own representative.

(9) The trustee shall, where practicable, procure the
removal from office of a director appointed for the purpose

instrument, the trustee shall have power, in the management or
administration of the trust fund, to sell or otherwise dispose

not exercising such power, for losses of the kind

that the section permits the Court to confer upon the trustee
any power of sale or other disposal.

application of any interested person, to order or authorize a
sale or other disposal of the designated shares, and a sale
or other disposal so ordered or authorized shall not require
any consent referred to in subsection 46i(3).

(2) In making an order or authorization under subsection
(1), the Court may impose such, if any, terms and conditions
in relation to the sale or other disposal as it thinks fit.

**Beneficiaries not entitled**

**46l.** (1) Notwithstanding any rule of equity or practice of the
Court to the contrary, but subject to subsection (2), neither
a beneficiary who is solely interested in any designated
shares, nor all the beneficiaries who together are the persons
interested in any designated shares, shall be entitled, although
in existence and ascertained and of full capacity, to call

modify the trust relating to the shares, if and so far as that
entitlement is, without offending any rule of perpetuity or
remoteness, excluded by the trust instrument.

continue to have effect, after the expiration of twenty years
from the creation of the trust.


-----

48 _Bill_

virtue of such an exclusion of entitlement, has no present
right to receive the shares or that interest, he shall, without
prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), hold those

interest to the trustee, and the Court shall order him to do
so on the application by the trustee or any person specified
in subsection 46j(3).

practicable to consult him, his wishes shall be taken to
be–

_(a) such wishes as he has most recently communicated_
to the trustee, or

_(b) where no wishes have been communicated, such as_
the Court, or the trustee in good faith, believes most
likely to have been his wishes from the evidence
available in respect of the wishes.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Labuan Offshore Trusts Act 1996 (“Act 554”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the Act and provision on the_
commencement of the proposed Act.

3. _Clauses 2 and_ _3 seek to amend the long title and the short title of Act_
554 respectively by deleting the word “Offshore”. The deletion is due to the
Labuan branding exercise as a new Labuan International Financial Centre
and to ensure consistency in respect of Labuan Offshore Financial Services
Authority’s (hereinafter referred to as “LOFSA”) designation with the other
Labuan legislations.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 554 to introduce new definitions_
and to amend existing definitions used in Act 554.

5. _Clause 5 seeks to delete sections 4 and 5 of Act 554 which will now_
be covered under new sections 11a until 11e, inserted by _clause 15 into the_
proposed Act. The intention of the amendments is to place the subject matter
of the deleted sections, i.e. purpose trust and charitable trust, under Part II
of Act 554 which relates to the creation and recognition of offshore trusts.


-----

_Labuan Offshore Trusts (Amendment)_ 53

6. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 554 to provide for a comprehensive_
meaning of “proper law”, in particular, how it is determined and also sets out
matters to be governed by the proper law. This _clause_ further provide for the
place of administration of trust.

7. _Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new Part, i.e. Part Ia, which contains two_
new sections 6a and 6b into Act 554. Section 6a sets out that LOFSA is
responsible for the administration of the Act subject to the general directions
of the Minister whilst section 6b empowers LOFSA to appoint authorized
officers.

8. Clause _9 seeks to amend section 7 of Act 554 to allow Malaysian immovable_
properties to be included as part of the trust property. This clause also seeks to
allow a Malaysian resident to be a beneficiary of a Labuan trust provided that
the trust properties are foreign properties, and to allow a Malaysian resident
to be a settlor of a Labuan trust provided that the trust properties are foreign
properties. This _clause further requires that at least one of the trustees of the_
Labuan trust shall be a Labuan trust company.

9. _Clause 11 seeks to introduce two new sections, namely sections 8a and_
8b into Act 554. Section 8a provides that all proceedings (other than criminal
proceedings) in respect of a Labuan trust must be held in camera and seeks to
prohibit the disclosure of any information relating to the affairs of a Labuan
trust while section 8b relates to the retention of certain rights by the settlor.

10. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 10 of Act 554 to provide for a more_
comprehensive protection for trust property and to include protection from
foreign claims or the application of foreign laws in regard to any disposition
of property to the trust and the capacity of the settlor.

11. _Clause 14 seeks to introduce a new subsection (6a) into section 11 of_
Act 554. This amendment seeks to restrict the application of section 11 in
the circumstances where the settlor is a resident.

12. _Clause 15 seeks to introduce the new sections 11a, 11b, 11c, 11d and_
11e into Act 554. As mentioned earlier, in paragraph 5, the new sections set
out provisions on purpose trusts and charitable trusts which were previously
contained in the deleted sections 4 and 5. New section 11c seeks to introduce
provisions relating to “enforcers” while section 11d provides that a purpose trust
is not to be rendered void merely by uncertainty. New section 11e provides
for spendthrift or protective trust.

13. _Clause 16 seeks to amend section 12 of Act 554 to address the issue of_
Labuan trusts using misleading or undesirable names. With this amendment,
LOFSA is empowered to refuse registering a trust if the name of the trust is
misleading or undesirable.

14. _Clause 20 seeks to amend section 16 of Act 554 to clarify that Labuan_
trusts are not subject to the perpetuity rule, and also to empower the trustee
to change a perpetual trust to a trust of fixed duration and to appoint a fixed
duration or to alter the duration of trust.


-----

54 _Bill_

15. _Clause 23 seeks to amend section 19 of Act 554 to ensure that the_
statutory provision does not defeat the settlor’s intention of creating the trust.
The amendment seeks to strike a balance between the wishes of the beneficiaries
and that of the settlor. This _clause also provides that if the terms of the trust_
disallow termination of the trust by the beneficiaries, the beneficiaries may
apply to the Court for the termination of the trust and the Court may approve
such termination if it is satisfied that termination is consistent with the material
purpose of the trust.

16. _Clause 26 seeks to amend section 22 of Act 554 to enable the terms of_
a trust to provide for the addition of a person to be a beneficiary, to exclude
a person from being a beneficiary and to impose upon a beneficiary any
obligation as a condition for a benefit under the trust.

17. _Clause 27 seeks to amend the existing section 23 of Act 554 to enable a_
beneficiary to disclaim the whole or any part of his interest despite the terms
of the trust.

18. _Clause 31 seeks to introduce a new subsection (1a) into section 30 of_
Act 554. This amendment seeks to adopt a more modern approach in regard to
a trustee’s duty of care based on the UK Trustees Act 2000 and the Singapore
Trustees Act. Any special knowledge or experience that the trustee has or that
he holds himself out as having, and any special knowledge or experience that
is reasonably expected of a professional trustee is taken into account in the
execution of his duties as a trustee.

19. _Clause 32 seeks to amend section 31 of Act 554 to require a trustee, who_
dissent from a decision of the majority of the trustees, to cause his dissent to
be recorded in writing.

20. _Clause 33 seeks to amend section 33 of Act 554 to require a trustee to_
insure the trust property against any loss or damage and to pay the premium
out of the income or capital funds of the trust.

21. _Clause 34 seeks to introduce two new sections, namely sections 33a and_
33b into Act 554. Section 33a seeks to provide for the power of investment
of the trustee. Section 33a impose certain safeguards on the trustee’s power
of investment, in particular, to require the trustee to have regard to standard
investment criteria and considerations, including the suitability of proposed
investments and the need for diversification of investments of the trust. Section
33b requires the trustee to obtain proper advice relating to any proposed
investment from qualified persons.

22. _Clause 35 seeks to amend section 35 of Act 554 to set out the role and_
powers of a protector in more detail.

23. _Clause 36 seeks to amend section 36 of Act 554 to introduce certain_
safeguards in relation to the trustee’s power of delegation, in particular to
specify certain non-delegable functions and in this regard, delegable functions
in respect of charitable trusts should vary from that of non-charitable trusts and


-----

_Labuan Offshore Trusts (Amendment)_ 55

to impose strict requirements in respect of delegation of property management
functions and to require trustees to keep under review the terms of the delegation
and how the person appointed is performing.

24. _Clause 37 seeks to introduce two new sections, namely sections 36a and_
36b into Act 554. Section 36a deals with the delegation of powers in relation
to property management functions while section 36b deals with the review of
agents.

25. _Clause 38 seeks to amend section 41 of Act 554 to provide the necessary_
exceptions to confidentiality of trust information and further, to restrict the
obligation to disclose such information to any beneficiary having a vested or
contingent interest in a trust.

26. _Clause 39 seeks to amend section 42 of Act 554. This amendment_
seeks to delete subsections 42(2) and (3) as the provisions create unjustified
discrimination against directors of fiduciary business compared to other
professionals and the continued existence of the discrimination may deter
international service providers from setting up business in Labuan. In addition,
the amendment seeks to provide that exculpation clauses in trust instrument
are not enforceable under certain specified circumstances. A trustee should
not be liable to a beneficiary for breach of trust if the beneficiary consented
to the conduct constituting the breach, had released the trustee from liability
for the breach or had ratified the transaction constituting the breach.

27. _Clause 40 seeks to introduce new sections 42a and 42b into Act 554._
Section 42a empowers the Court to make an order to prevent a breach of
trust from occurring while section 42b empowers the Court to make an order
to remedy a breach of trust that has occurred.

28. _Clause 41 seeks to amend section 46 of Act 554 to introduce appropriate_
measures to avoid a gap in the trusteeship when a trustee retires.

29. _Clause 42 seeks to introduce a new Part, namely Part IVa which consists_
of new sections 46a, 46b, 46c, 46d, 46e, 46f, 46g, 46h, 46i, 46j, 46k, 46l,
46m, 46n, 46o and 46p, into Act 554. This new Part provides for the creation
of Labuan Special Trust.

30. _Clause 44 seeks to amend section 52 of Act 554 to shorten the limitation_
period under subsection 52(2) from the current six years to three years. The
present limitation period of six years under subsection 52(2) is too long
compared to other jurisdictions.

31. _Clause 45_ seeks to amend section 53 of Act 554 to increase the penalty
for an offence of receiving money or other property from illegal activities
from thirty thousand ringgit to three million ringgit.

32. _Clause 47 seeks to amend section 57 of Act 554 to empower the Minister_
to set out the penalties that may be prescribed in regulations made under the
Act.


-----

56 _Bill_

33. _Clause 48 seeks to amend section 58 of Act 554 to empower the Minister,_
on the recommendation of LOFSA, to exempt any person from any of the
provisions of this Act.

34. _Clause 51 seeks to introduce a new section, namely section 63, into Act_
554 to provide that in the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions
of Act 554 and the Labuan Financial Services Authority Act 1996 [Act 545],
the provisions of the Labuan Financial Services Authority Act 1996 shall
prevail.

35. _Clause 52 of this proposed Act contains the savings provision._

36. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

The Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial
expenditure.
