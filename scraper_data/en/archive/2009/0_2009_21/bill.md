EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Goods and Services Tax Bill 2009 (“the proposed Act”) seeks to provide
for the imposition and collection of goods and services tax (GST) and for
matters connected therewith. The GST is a broad-based consumption tax based
on a value-added concept. With the coming into operation of section 9 and
Parts XVI and XVII of the proposed Act (“the appointed date”), the GST will
replace the sales tax and the service tax currently imposed and collected under


-----

_Goods and Services Tax_ 157

the Sales Tax Act 1972 and the Service Tax Act 1975. Unlike the present
sales tax which is a single stage tax, the GST is a multi-stage tax. Payment of
tax is made in stages by the intermediaries in the production and distribution
process. The tax itself is not a cost to the intermediaries and does not appear
as an expense item in their financial statements.

GST covers all sectors of the industry and is a tax on final consumption of
goods and services. It is collected through a credit system where GST incurred
on inputs is offset against GST charged on outputs.

2. Part I of the proposed Act deals with preliminary matters.

_Clause 1 provides for the short title and the power of the Minister to_
appoint the date of commencement of the proposed Act.

_Clause 2 contains the definitions of the words and expressions used in the_
proposed Act.

_Clause 3 seeks to provide for the general meaning of business in the_
proposed Act which includes the activities of clubs and similar organizations,
and paid admission into premises. This clause also seeks to extend the meaning
of business to include the termination of business and disposal of assets or
transfer of business as a going concern to be a supply made in the course or
furtherance of business, but excludes employment under contracts of service
and hobbies.

_Clause 4 seeks to provide for the meaning of supply and the supply of_
goods or the supply of services, as well as matters that are to be treated as
a supply of goods or a supply of services as listed in the First Schedule and
matters that are to be treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of
services as listed in the Second Schedule. This _clause also gives power to_
the Minister to amend the First and Second Schedules.

3. Part II sets out the administration of the GST.

_Clause 5 seeks to provide that the Director General has superintendence over_
all matters relating to GST. Officers of customs with the rank of Superintendent
or higher shall have and exercise all the powers of the Director General other
than excepted powers.

_Clause 6_ seeks to require officers of goods and services tax to identify
themselves when performing their duties and any person may refuse an order
made by the officers if they do not identify themselves. This _clause also_
provides that unlawfully wearing, using, possessing or displaying an authority
card or badge of an officer of goods and services tax is an offence.

_Clause 7 seeks to provide that all officers of goods and services tax shall_
be deemed to be public servants.

_Clause 8 deals with the confidentiality of all documents handled by officers_
of goods and services tax or any other government officers having official
duties. It shall be an offence for any person who misuses any information or
documents other than for the purposes of carrying on his duties. This _clause_


-----

158 _Bill_

allows the officer of goods and services tax not to divulge any information
or document to any person except in the course of carrying out his duties
as an officer of goods and services tax or in the case of prosecution of an
offence in court. The Director General may share information with the Director
General of Inland Revenue and the Chief Statistician in the performance of his
official government duties. This _clause_ also gives the power to the Minister
to disclose any information or document to any person he deems fit.

4. Part III contains provisions relating to the imposition and scope of tax.

_Clause 9 seeks to provide for the chargeability of tax on any taxable supply_
made in Malaysia by a taxable person in the course or furtherance of business
and includes goods and services supplied locally as well as imported. This
_clause places the liability of tax on the person who makes the supply and_
provides for GST to be charged and payable on all importation of goods into
Malaysia as if it were customs duty.

_Clause 10 seeks to provide for the tax to be charged on the value of the_
supply or importation based on the rate of tax as determined by the Minister.
This _clause provides for the procedure in fixing the tax rate and a refund of_
tax may be made under specified conditions.

_Clause 11_ seeks to provide for the time of supply rules for the purposes
of chargeability of tax and determines the general time of supply rules for
goods and services. It also determines the time of supply to be triggered when
a tax invoice is issued or payment is received whichever is the earlier. The
time of supply is the date the invoice is issued if the invoice is issued within
21 days after the supply is made. This _clause_ allows the Director General to
determine the time of supply under special circumstances such as when goods
are transferred or disposed of and privately used, one-off use or as and when
it is used. This clause also provides for the special time of supply rules under
certain circumstances and the application of special time of supply rules for
supply made separately and successively as prescribed under the regulations
to be made under the proposed Act.

_Clause 12_ seeks to provide for the place of supply rules for the purpose
of chargeability of tax and determines the place of supply for goods. The
place of supply is in Malaysia if the supply is made from a place in Malaysia
to another place in Malaysia or if the goods are removed from a place in
Malaysia to a place outside Malaysia. The place of supply is treated to be
outside Malaysia if the goods are brought in from a place outside Malaysia.
This _clause also determines the place of supply for services. If the supplier_
belongs in Malaysia then the place of supply is in Malaysia.

_Clause 13 sets out the treatment of imported services as a supply by and_
to the recipient and the manner of accounting for tax on imported services
by a taxable person and any person other than a taxable person.

_Clause 14 seeks to determine the country where the supplier or recipient_
of services belongs based on his business or fixed establishment or his usual
place of residence in that country. This _clause also seeks to provide for any_
business establishment to be regarded as belonging in Malaysia if the business
establishment has a branch or agency in Malaysia.


-----

_Goods and Services Tax_ 159

_Clause 15_ seeks to provide the rules in determining the value of supply
except as provided for in the Third Schedule that is the value of supply to
be the consideration in money excluding tax. It also provides for the value
of supply (which includes excise duty) to be determined by using the open
market value under certain circumstances where there is no consideration or
the consideration is not wholly in money. Where the consideration covers more
than one supply, the _clause seeks to require apportioning the consideration_
received that is attributable to the supply. This _clause seeks to empower the_
Minister to amend the Third Schedule and to determine the value of supply
under special circumstances.

_Clause 16 seeks to provide for the computation of value of goods imported_
for the purpose of charging GST.

_Clause 17 seeks to empower the Minister to treat any supply of goods or_
services as a zero-rated supply by way of an order published in the _Gazette._
The supply of goods if the goods are exported is also treated as a zero-rated
supply. The supply of goods or services which are zero-rated shall be treated
as a taxable supply and shall be charged at zero per cent and in the case of
goods imported into Malaysia no tax is to be charged. This _clause provides_
for the liability to pay tax and the seizure of goods that are claimed to have
been exported but found in Malaysia.

_Clause 18 seeks to empower the Minister to determine any supply of_
goods or services to be an exempt supply by way of an order published in
the _Gazette_ whereby no tax is to be charged on the exempt supply and the
exempt supply goods which are imported into Malaysia.

5. Part IV sets out the provisions for the registration of taxable persons.

_Clause 19 seeks to provide for the general provisions for the registration of_
taxable persons. It also provides for any reference to a supply to be confined
to a supply made for business purposes and that the value of the supply would
be taken as tax exclusive.

_Clause 20 seeks to empower the Minister to determine the threshold level_
for mandatory registration by way of an order published in the _Gazette. This_
_clause_ provides for the computation of annual turnover for the purposes of
determining the liability to be registered. The value of supplies made during
the period in which the taxable person was previously registered for the
purposes of calculating the annual turnover is excluded. The value of sale
of capital assets, imported services and supplies made within or between
designated areas for the purpose of determining the liability to be registered
is also excluded. This _clause also provides for the use of a prescribed form_
in making an application to be registered.

_Clause 21 seeks to require a person to notify his liability to register within_
28 days from the end of his liability to register and the registration date to
start on the first day after the month in which he makes the notification
to register or an earlier date as may be agreed. This _clause also requires a_
person to notify his liability to the Director General within 28 days from the
date when the business is transferred and Director General shall register him
accordingly. The Director General may predetermine a registration date if the
person fails to notify his liability to register. Any reference to registration of


-----

160 _Bill_

persons shall refer to registration in a register kept by the Director General.
If a person fails to register within the stipulated period he shall be liable to
pay late registration penalty based on a specified percentage rate.

_Clause 22 deals with the cessation of a person’s liability to be registered._
This _clause further provides that the liability to register does not cease if_
the person’s annual turnover has not exceeded the threshold due to expected
cessation of making taxable supplies or suspension of making taxable supplies
for 30 days or more. It excludes the value of sale of capital assets and imported
services for the purpose of determining the end of liability to be registered.

_Clause 23 seeks to empower the Director General to direct two or more_
taxable persons to be registered as a single taxable person. It explains the
determination of artificial separation of business to take into consideration the
extent of financial, economic and organizational links. The Director General
shall make the direction subject to certain conditions specified. Each direction
is to be served on every person named. This _clause also gives power to the_
Director General to direct another person other than those persons named in
the earlier direction. Upon the revocation of a registered person (to end his
liability) if he is named as one of the persons in the direction, he together with
all other persons shall be registered as a single taxable person. The persons
named in the direction are to be known as constituent members after they are
registered. It stipulates the responsibilities of the single taxable person and the
treatment of constituent members as a partnership. The Director General may
disregard a person to be a constituent member and that person shall cease to
have any liability after he has ceased to be a member of the partnership.

_Clause 24 seeks to allow for voluntary registration of any person who is_
not liable to be registered, subject to certain conditions. Upon registration, the
person shall remain to be registered for a period of not less than two years.
This _clause also allows for voluntary registration of a person who makes or_
intends to make a taxable supply outside Malaysia. This _clause provides for_
the use of a prescribed form in making the application to be registered and
enables the Director General to cancel the registration of a person if he does
not make a taxable supply by the stipulated date or he has breached any
conditions imposed.

_Clause 25 seeks to require a person to notify the Director General within_
a stipulated period if he ceases to make a taxable supply or intends to cease
making a taxable supply.

_Clause 26 seeks to allow the Director General to cancel a person’s_
registration upon request or notification if he is satisfied that such person
can be deregistered. This _clause also allows the Director General to cancel_
the person’s registration if he is satisfied that the person has ceased to be
registrable effective from the date he so ceases or such later date or if he is
neither liable nor eligible to be registered.


-----

_Goods and Services Tax_ 161

_Clause 27 seeks to allow two or more companies to apply for group_
registration if certain conditions are satisfied. The registration of the group shall
be in the name of the representative member. This clause further provides for
the treatment of supplies between members of a group and the joint liability
of every member of a group.

_Clause 28 seeks to provide for the registration of partnership in the name of_
the firm and that any changes in the partnership shall not affect the registration
and accounting for tax. A partner is liable for any tax due unless he notifies
that he has ceased to be a partner. This _clause also seeks to provide that any_
service of notice to the firm during the taxable period in which the partner is
liable shall be treated as having been served on him although he has ceased
to be a partner. Further, the serving of notice to the firm shall be deemed to
have been served on a partnership. Any notice given by any partner shall be
deemed as a notice given by all partners of the firm.

_Clause 29 seeks to provide for the registration of societies and similar_
organizations. Any change in the members shall not affect the registration and
accounting for tax. It also provides for the joint and several responsibility of
the principal office bearers and any member of a committee.

_Clause 30 deals with the registration of businesses carried on in branches or_
divisions and the conditions and requirements for the registration of business
carried on by branches or divisions. The Director General shall terminate the
registration if they breach certain conditions and also determine the date of
termination of registration. This clause provides for a taxable person to apply
for the termination of registration effective from the date of application or
a later date as determined by Director General and the taxable person shall
remain registered for a period of not less than two years unless the Director
General otherwise allows.

_Clause 31 seeks to allow the Director General to deem a personal_
representative carrying on business on behalf of a taxable person as a taxable
person himself and limits the tax liability of the personal representative to
the extent of control of the business assets. This _clause_ requires the personal
representative to notify the Director General, within 21 days from the date the
personal representative takes over, the fact of the death, liquidation, receivership,
bankruptcy or incapacity. It also requires the personal representative to set
aside an amount sufficient to pay tax or penalty. The personal representative
shall be personally liable in the event he fails to notify or pay the tax or
penalty and, in case of two or more personal representatives, they shall be
jointly and severally liable.

_Clause 32_ seeks to exempt a taxable person from registration if he makes
wholly a zero-rated supply and requires any person who is exempted from
registration to notify the Director General within 30 days from the date of
any change in the nature of his supply.

6. Part V contains provisions on accounting, assessment and recovery of
tax.


-----

162 _Bill_

_Clause 33 seeks to require a registered person to issue a tax invoice stating_
the amount payable excluding tax, the rate of tax and the total tax chargeable
separately. However, it exempts a registered person from issuing a tax invoice
and allows omission of any prescribed particulars under certain conditions. It
also provides the issuance of a self-billed invoice subject to the approval of
the Director General. This _clause also seeks to prohibit the issuance of a tax_
invoice for second-hand goods and supply of imported services.

_Clause 34 seeks to allow tax invoices to be transmitted or made available_
by electronic means.

_Clause 35 seeks to require both the supplier and recipient to make adjustments_
if the supplier issues a credit note or debit note.

_Clause 36 seeks to require a taxable person to keep records in relation to_
his tax liability in Malaysia either in the national or English language for
7 years. This _clause also seeks to allow for the preservation of records or_
information in the manner approved by the Director General. Such records
shall be admissible as evidence in any proceedings.

_Clause 37 seeks to require a taxable person to account for tax at the time_
of supply and subject to the Director General’s approval, allow a registered
person to account for tax on payment basis. It also empowers the Minister to
make regulations for tax adjustments in respect of the change of accounting
basis.

_Clause 38 seeks to allow a taxable person to deduct his input tax from the_
output tax in the return. This _clause_ seeks to treat flat rate addition as input
tax and also limit the proportion of tax which is attributable to business to
be counted as input tax. It also allows the Director General to refund any
credit or credit that exceeds the output tax and allows any credit due to be
carried forward to the next taxable period either by application or as directed
by the Director General. The Director General shall withhold the refund if a
taxable person fails to comply with any obligation under the proposed Act
or request made by the Director General. This _clause_ also provides the time
frame for the Director General to make a refund and requires a taxable person
to account any input tax that has been credited or refunded as his output tax
if he fails to pay the consideration to the supplier. It allows a taxable person
to claim back his input tax if he has subsequently paid the consideration to
the supplier. This _clause_ further excludes certain supply of goods or services
from any input tax credit.

_Clause 39 seeks to restrict the amount of input tax as credit for the purposes_
of making certain supplies only and provides certain exempt supply to be
treated as taxable supply subject to the prescribed conditions.

_Clause 40 seeks to allow the Director General to assign the category of_
taxable period for the taxable person and assign a different category of taxable
period based on application or by direction. This clause provides for a default
taxable period and allows the Director General to vary the taxable period.


-----

_Goods and Services Tax_ 163

_Clause 41 seeks to require a taxable person to account for tax in a return_
and furnish it within the stipulated time. A person who has been approved a
varied taxable period has to submit a return within 30 days from the end of
each varied taxable period. A taxable person shall submit a final return within
the stipulated period in the event of deregistration and pay any tax due. This
_clause also requires a taxable person to pay for the tax and to furnish a return_
whether or not there is tax to be paid. It also provides for contravention of
this _clause to be an offence._

_Clause 42 seeks to require a person other than a taxable person to account_
for tax in a declaration and furnish it within the stipulated time. This _clause_
requires a person other than a taxable person to pay for the tax. It also provides
for the contravention of this _clause to be an offence._

_Clause 43 seeks to allow the Director General to assess the amount of tax_
payable if a taxable person fails to apply for registration, fails to furnish a
return or furnishes an incomplete or incorrect return. This _clause_ limits the
time frame of not more than 6 years after the end of a taxable period for the
Director General to make an assessment except in cases of fraud. It also allows
the Director General to make an assessment where goods are not supplied
or exported unless the taxable person can prove that the goods are lost or
destroyed. The Director General shall increase the amount of tax assessed in
the case where a taxable person pays tax according to the assessed amounts
but continually fails to submit returns. This clause further deems the assessed
amount to be the correct tax that is due from the taxable person unless the
assessment is subsequently withdrawn or reduced. This _clause also allows_
the Director General to make a supplementary assessment in excess of an
earlier assessment and amend the assessment to ensure the correctness of his
assessment.

_Clause 44 seeks to allow the Director General to disregard any transaction_
in relation to tax avoidance and deem any person as a taxable person, any
supply as a taxable supply, to place a supply in a specific taxable period and
to fix the value of any supply at open market value. This _clause seeks to_
exclude any genuine commercial transactions with no intention of obtaining
tax advantage.

_Clause 45 sets out the imposition of late payment penalty to any taxable_
person or any person other than a taxable person whose tax remains unpaid.

_Clause 46 seeks to allow the Director General to offset any refund against_
any unpaid tax or customs or excise duty.

_Clause 47 empowers the Minister to recover any tax due and payable or_
any penalty or surcharge as a civil debt. It also provides for the recovery of
