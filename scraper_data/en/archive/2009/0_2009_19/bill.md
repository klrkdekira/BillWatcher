EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Personal Data Protection Act 2009 (“the Act”) as proposed by this Bill
seeks to regulate the processing of personal data of individuals involved
in commercial transactions by data users so as to provide protection to the
individual’s (“data subject’s”) personal data and thereby safeguard the interests of
such individual. New technologies and changing market trends are contributing
to the increasingly important role of information in the global market economy.


-----

94 _Bill_

This information, in particular the personal data of individuals involved in
commercial transactions, has become a valuable commodity. This in turn has
created mounting pressure to regulate the processing of personal data so as
to increase consumer confidence in the current global economy.

The Act also seeks to appoint a Personal Data Protection Commissioner
(“Commissioner”) to implement the provisions of the Act, as well as establishes
a Personal Data Protection Advisory Committee (“Advisory Committee”) that
advises the Commissioner on matters relating to personal data protection. An
Appeal Tribunal (“Tribunal”) is also established under the Act to provide an
avenue to appeal against the decisions of the Commissioner. The Act also
provides for matters connected with and incidental to the abovementioned
matters.

PART I

2. Part I of the Act deals with preliminary matters.

3. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the Act and provisions on the_
commencement of the Act, and seeks to allow the Minister to appoint different
dates for the coming into operation of different provisions of the Act.

any person who processes personal data or who has control over or authorizes
the processing of personal data of individuals in respect of commercial
transactions.

5. _Clause 3 provides for the non-application of the Act. The Act shall not_
apply to the Federal Government and State Governments. The Act shall not
apply to any personal data processed outside Malaysia unless the personal
data is intended to be further processed in Malaysia.

6. Clause 4 contains the definition of certain expressions used in the Act.

PART II

7. Part II of the Act which contains Divisions I, II, III and IV deals with
specific provisions on personal data protection.

Data Protection Principles that govern the protection of an individual’s personal
data.

9. _Clause 5 specifies the Personal Data Protection Principles, namely, the_
General Principle, Notice and Choice Principle, Disclosure Principle, Security
Principle, Retention Principle, Data Integrity Principle and Access Principle.
Any data user, unless exempted under the Act, who contravenes any of the
Personal Data Protection Principles commits an offence.

10. _Clause 6 deals with the General Principle involving the processing of_
personal data, including sensitive personal data. A data user shall not process
personal data about an individual unless that individual has given his consent


-----

_Personal Data Protection_ 95

to the processing of the personal data. However, this _clause sets out certain_
circumstances where the consent of the individual is not required for the
processing of such personal data. This clause further provides that in the case
of sensitive personal data of an individual, the data user shall not process
such personal data unless in accordance with the provisions of _clause 40._

11. _Clause 7 deals with the Notice and Choice Principle, that is, a data_
user shall by written notice inform an individual that personal data of which
that individual is the data subject is being processed by or on behalf of the
data user. The notice shall contain such matters that include the purpose for
which the personal data is being processed, the source of the personal data
and whether it is obligatory or voluntary for the individual to provide the
personal data. The data user shall also provide the data subject a choice and
means of limiting the processing of personal data, including personal data
relating to other persons who may be identified from that personal data.

12. _Clause 8 deals with the Disclosure Principle which provides that personal_
data shall not without the consent of the data subject be disclosed for any
purpose other than the purpose for which the personal data was to be disclosed
at the time of collection of the personal data or a purpose directly related
to it, or be disclosed to a third party other than that specified in the notice.
However, this clause is subject to clause 39 that sets out the circumstances where
personal data may be disclosed without the consent of the data subject.

13. _Clause 9 deals with the Security Principle that provides that, when_
processing personal data, a data user shall take practical steps to protect the
personal data from any loss, misuse, modification, unauthorized or accidental
access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.

14. _Clause 10 deals with the Retention Principle which provides that personal_
data processed for any purpose shall not be kept longer than is necessary for
the fulfilment of that purpose.

15. _Clause 11 deals with the Data Integrity Principle which specifies_
that personal data must be accurate, complete, not misleading and kept
up-to-date.

16. _Clause 12_ deals with the Access Principle which provides that a data
subject shall be given access to his personal data and be able to correct that
personal data, except where compliance with a request to such access or
correction is refused under the Act.

17. Division 2 of Part II contains _clauses 13 to_ _20 that provide for the_
registration of specific classes of data users.

belonging to a class of data users who is required to be registered under the
Act. Clause 14 seeks to provide that the Minister may, upon the recommendation
of the Commissioner, by order published in the _Gazette_ specify a class of
data users who shall be required to be registered as data users. However, a
data user who does not belong to the abovementioned class of data users shall
comply with all the provisions of the Act other than the provisions of this
Division relating to the registration of data users.


-----

96 _Bill_

19. _Clause 15 sets out the provisions relating to application for the registration_
of a data user under the Act.

20. _Clause_ _16 provides that the Commissioner may refuse an application for_
registration, or approve such application and issue a certificate of registration
that may be subject to such conditions or restrictions as the Commissioner may
think fit to impose. It also makes it an offence for a person who belongs to a
class of data users that is required to be registered under the Act to process
personal data without a certificate of registration.

21. _Clause 17_ provides for the renewal of a certificate of registration and
also sets out the circumstances under which the Commissioner may refuse to
renew the certificate.

22. _Clause 18 sets out the grounds upon which the Commissioner may revoke_
the registration of a data user under the Act, while _clause 19 requires the_
holder of the certificate of registration whose registration has been revoked
to surrender the certificate to the Commissioner within a stipulated time.

23. _Clause 20 provides that the Commissioner shall maintain a Register_
of Data Users containing such information as may be determined by the
Commissioner.

24. Division 3 of Part II contains clauses 21 to 29 that provide for data user
forums and codes of practice.

25. _Clause 21_ enables the Commissioner to designate a body as a data user
forum in respect of a specific class of data users. The Commissioner shall
register the designation of the data user forum and he may withdraw the
designation by cancelling its registration.

26. _Clause 22_ provides that the Commissioner shall maintain a Register of
Data User Forums containing such information as may be determined by the
Commissioner.

27. _Clause 23_ provides that the data user forum may prepare a code of
practice for a class of data users either on its own initiative or upon the
request of the Commissioner. The code of practice takes into account various
matters stipulated in this _clause,_ including the purpose for the processing of
personal data by data users or classes of data users, and the views of data
subjects and relevant regulatory authorities. The Commissioner may refuse
to register or may approve and register the code of practice prepared by the
data user forum which shall take effect from the date of its registration. The
Commissioner may register different codes of practice for different classes of
data users.

28. _Clause 24 enables the Commissioner to issue a code of practice if a_
code of practice is not prepared by a data user forum or there is no data user
forum to develop the relevant code of practice for a specific class of data
users. The code of practice is registered by the Commissioner and he may
issue different codes of practice for different classes of data users.


-----

_Personal Data Protection_ 97

29. _Clause 25 provides that the Commissioner shall ensure that there is only_
one code of practice registered for a class of data users at a given time. If there
is any uncertainty or ambiguity as to which code of practice is applicable to
a particular data user or class of data users, the Commissioner shall provide
his opinion on such matter within thirty days from the date of receipt of an
application in respect of this matter.

30. _Clause 26 enables the Commissioner to revoke, amend or revise any_
code of practice, whether in whole or in part, either on his own accord or
upon an application by the data user forums or such bodies representing the
data users.

31. _Clause 27 enables the data user forum to submit a new code of practice_
to replace the existing code of practice.

32. _Clause 28_ provides that the Commissioner shall maintain a Register of
Codes of Practice containing such information, including that in respect of
codes of practice registered by the Commissioner and opinions made by the

a code of practice which is applicable to that data user.

34. Division 4 of Part II contains clauses 30 to 44 and deals with the rights
of a data subject.

35. _Clause 30_ provides that an individual is entitled to be informed by a
data user whether personal data of which that individual is the data subject is
being processed by or on behalf of that data user. A data subject or a relevant
person may make a data access request to the data user for information on
the data subject’s personal data and to have that information communicated
to him in an intelligible form.

36. _Clause 31 provides that a data user upon receipt of a data access_
request shall comply with that data access request within a prescribed period.
Notwithstanding _clause 31, the data user may refuse to comply with such_
request in accordance with circumstances as set out in _clause 32 and he shall_
inform the person who made the request of such refusal in accordance with
_clause 33._

37. _Clause 34 provides that a data subject or relevant person may make a_
data correction request to the data user requesting that corrections be made to
the data subject’s personal data which is inaccurate, incomplete, misleading
or not up-to-date.

38. _Clause 35_ provides that where a data user is satisfied that the personal
data to which a data correction request relates is inaccurate, incomplete,
misleading or not up-to-date, he shall make the necessary corrections to the
personal data and supply the person making the request a copy of the personal
data as corrected.


-----

98 _Bill_

39. _Clause 36 provides the circumstances where a_ data user may refuse to
comply with a data correction request, and the data user shall notify the person
making the request of such refusal in accordance with _clause 37. However,_
_clause 37 further provides that where the personal data is an expression of_
opinion and the data user refuses to make the necessary correction, he shall
make a note of the matters in respect of which the opinion is considered to
be inaccurate by the person making the request. The note shall be annexed
to the personal data in such a way that the personal data cannot be used by
any person without the note being drawn to the attention of such person.

40. _Clause 38 provides that the data subject may by written notice withdraw_
his consent to the processing of personal data of which he is the data subject.
The data user shall cease to process the personal data upon receipt of the
notice and he commits an offence if he fails to do so.

41. _Clause 39 sets out the circumstances where a data user may, without_
the consent of the data subject, disclose personal data of the data subject for
any purpose other than the purpose for which the personal data was to be
disclosed at the time of collection of the personal data or any other purpose
directly related to that purpose.

42. _Clause 40 provides that sensitive personal data shall not be processed_
except in the circumstances as specified in this _clause._

43. _Clause 41 provides that where a data user subsequently collects personal_
data, he is not required to comply with the provisions of the Notice and
Choice Principle in respect of the subsequent collection if to comply with the
provisions of the Notice and Choice Principle would be a repeat, in the same
circumstances, with what was done to comply with that principle in respect
of the first collection of the personal data. In addition to this, not more than
twelve months must have elapsed between the first collection and subsequent
collection.

44. _Clause 42 provides that a data subject may require the data user to_
cease or not to begin processing or processing for a specified purpose or
in a specified manner, personal data of which he is the data subject, on the
ground that such processing causes or is likely to cause substantial damage
or distress to him or another person and that damage or distress is or would
be unwarranted. However, this clause further sets out the circumstances where
the data user is not required to comply with the data subject’s request and he
may continue to process the personal data.

45. _Clause 43_ provides that a data subject may require the data user to
cease or not to begin processing his personal data for direct marketing. For
