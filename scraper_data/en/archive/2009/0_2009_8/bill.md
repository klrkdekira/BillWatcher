this Act or under the laws specified in the Schedule, any statement,
whether the statement amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in
writing, made at any time, whether before or after the person is
charged and whether in the course of an investigation or not and
whether or not wholly or partly in answer to questions, by an accused
person to or in the hearing of any investigating officer of the
Authority, whether or not interpreted to him by any officer of the
Authority or any other person, whether concerned or not in the arrest
of that person, shall, notwithstanding any written law or rule of law to
the contrary, be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if that person
tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in
cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit.

(2) No statement made under subsection (1) shall be admissible or
used as provided for in that subsection if the making of the statement
appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or
promise having reference to the charge against the person, proceeding
from a person in the Authority and sufficient in the opinion of the
court to give that person grounds which would appear to him
reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any
advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the
proceedings against him.

22 _Bill_

(3) Where any person is arrested or is informed that he
may be prosecuted for any criminal offence, he shall be
served with a notice in writing, which shall be explained
or interpreted to him, as the case may be, to the following
effect:

"You have been arrested/informed that you may be prosecuted for
.... (the possible criminal offence). Do you wish to say anything? If
there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in
court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till
you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed
and this may have an adverse effect on your case in general. If you
wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down,
this will be done."

(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3), a statement by any person
accused of any offence made before there is time to serve a notice
under that subsection shall not be rendered inadmissible in evidence
merely by reason of no such notice having been served on him if such
notice has been served on him as soon as is reasonably possible after
the statement is made.

(5) No statement made by an accused person in answer to a
written notice served on him pursuant to subsection (3) shall be
construed as a statement caused by any inducement, threat or promise
as is described in subsection (2), if it is otherwise voluntary.

(6) Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an
offence, evidence is given that the accused, on being informed that he
might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any such fact, being a
fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could
reasonably have been expected to mention when so informed, the
court, in determining whether the prosecution has made out a prima
_facie case against the accused and in determining whether the accused_
is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inferences from the
failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of those
inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to, corroboration
of any evidence given against the accused in relation to which the
failure is material.


-----

_(Amendment)_

(7) Nothing in subsection (6) shall in any criminal proceedings
_(a)_ prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or
other reaction of the accused in the face of anything said in
his presence relating to the conduct in respect of which he
is charged, in so far as evidence of it would be admissible
apart from that subsection; or

_(b)_ be taken to preclude the drawing of any inference from any
such silence or other reaction of the accused which could be
drawn apart from that subsection.

**Admissibility of statements and documents of persons who are**
**dead or cannot be traced**

**28K. Notwithstanding any written law to the contrary, in any**

officer in the course of an investigation into any offence
under this Act or the laws specified in the Schedule; and

_(b)_ any document, or copy of any document, seized from any
person by an investigating officer of the Authority in
exercise of his powers under this Act or the laws specified
in the Schedule,

shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings in Malaysia before
any court, where the person who made the statement or the document
or the copy of the document is dead, or cannot be traced or found, or
has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot
be procured without an amount of delay or expense which appears to
the court unreasonable.

true translation and the translation had been done by such person at
the instance of the officer authorised by the Authority, the Public
Prosecutor or an officer of any domestic law enforcement agency.

(2) Subsection (1) shall apply to a document which is translated,

Act or any offence under any other written law, regardless whether

recording, or other matter or material which is given in evidence or

information is named or described or shown, or which might lead to
his discovery, the court before which the proceedings are held shall
cause all such parts thereof or passages therein to be concealed from
view or to be obliterated or otherwise removed so far as is necessary
to protect such person from discovery.

(3) Any person who gives the information referred to in
