EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (“Act
671”). The proposed amendments seek to provide for the establishment of the
_Shariah Advisory Council for the Islamic capital market, to enhance corporate_
governance standards for directors and officers of listed corporations, and to
amend provisions relating to take-overs and mergers and for other incidental
matters.

2. _Clause 1 provides for the short title and provision on the commencement_
of the Bill.

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 2 of Act 671 to insert the definitions
of “Shariah Advisory Council” and “Islamic capital market business and
transaction” to be in line with the establishment of the _Shariah Advisory_
Council for the Islamic capital market.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend subsection 63(2) of Act 671 consequential to
the amendment made to section 23 of the Securities Commission Act 1993

[Act 498] relating to the establishment of a Fund. With the proposed amendment,
the licence fee shall be paid into the Fund to enable the Commission to
perform its additional regulatory functions which include providing independent
oversight over auditors of public interest entities.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to amend subsection 216(1) of Act 671 to amend existing
definitions of “control” and “take-over offer”.

The definition of “control” is amended to be in line with section 33 of
Act 498 to maintain the current threshold of control at more than thirty-three
per centum of voting shares or voting rights. The definition is also amended
to clarify that any control howsoever effected would be regulated under the
relevant provisions of Act 671.

The definition of “take-over offer” is substituted for the purpose of
clarification as to the situations which would give rise to a take-over offer that
would be regulated by the Code. The regulation of such offers is necessary to
ensure that shareholders are treated equally and that the interests of minority
shareholders are protected in the various circumstances in which take-over
and mergers are effected.

10 _Bill_

6. _Clause 5_ seeks to amend paragraph 220(1)(a) of Act 671 to clarify that
the Commission may direct any person in breach to comply with any such
provision of Division 2 of Part VI of Act 671.

7. _Clause 6_ seeks to amend subsection 222(1) of Act 671 in relation to the
compulsory acquisition of shares in a company by the offeror. The existing
subsection 222(1) does not reflect the current policy on the threshold for
compulsory acquisition which is currently reflected under subsection 34(1)
of Act 498. Subsection 34(1) of Act 498 provides that the ninety per centum
threshold excludes shares held by the offeror or persons acting in concert.
Hence, the amendment to subsection 222(1) seeks to maintain the similar
computation of the threshold for compulsory acquisition as is currently provided
for in subsection 34(1) of Act 498.

8. _Clause 7_ seeks to introduce new sections 316a, 316b, 316c, 316d, 316e,
316f, 316g and 316h into Act 671 to establish the _Shariah Advisory Council_
for the Islamic capital market and set out its functions and powers. The
establishment is in line with the Government’s aspiration to position Malaysia
as an international hub for Islamic finance. These provisions would place the
_Shariah Advisory Council for the Islamic capital market on sound statutory_
footing to ensure that the _Shariah Advisory Council for the Islamic capital_
market will continue to play an important role in the development of the
Islamic capital market.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to introduce a new section 317a to empower the Commission_
to take action against a director or an officer of a listed corporation who
causes wrongful loss to a listed corporation or its related corporations to the
detriment of the shareholders of a listed corporation and seeks to prevent the
assets of a listed corporation from being wrongfully dissipated by those who
manage the affairs of such listed corporation.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to amend subsection 319(4) of Act 671 to amend the_
cross-reference from subsection 319(1) to subsection 319(3) of Act 671 to
ensure that a listed corporation retains the accounting records referred to in
subsection 319(3) for a period of seven years.

11. _Clause 10 seeks to introduce a new section 320a to prohibit any person_
from influencing, coercing, misleading or authorizing any person engaged in the
preparation or in the audit of the financial statements of a listed corporation
or any of its related corporations to cause the financial statements or audited
financial statements to be false or misleading. This new section seeks to
ensure that the financial statements of a listed corporation are reliable source
of information to investors.

12. _Clause 11 seeks to amend subsection 368(1) of Act 671 to extend the_
provision to include the accounting records of a listed corporation and its
related corporations. This amendment seeks to prohibit the falsification of
accounting records of a listed corporation and its related corporations.

13. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 371 of Act 671 to enable the Commission_
to take action against a person who destroys, conceals, mutilates or alters the
accounting records of a listed corporation or its related corporations.
