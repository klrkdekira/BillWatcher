edge of the continental margin does not extend up
to that distance,

but shall not affect the territory of the States or the limits of

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Continental Shelf Act 1966 (“Act 83”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title._

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 to substitute the definition of “continental_
shelf” with a new definition to be in line with Article 76 of the 1982 United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS 1982). Malaysia is a
State Party to UNCLOS 1982, having signed the Convention on 10 December
1982 and ratified it on 14 October 1996. With this new definition, Malaysia
has sovereign rights to the outer edge of the continental margin, which
comprises the sea-bed and subsoil of the shelf, slope and rise provided that
it extends as the natural prolongation of the land territory or to a distance of
200 nautical miles from the baselines, from which the breadth of the territorial
sea is measured, if the continental margin does not extend to that distance. In
preserving the rights and powers of the State Authorities in the areas within
the limits of the territorial waters of the States, provision relating to the facts
of the matter is also inserted.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to introduce new sections 2a and 2b into Act 83. The new_
section 2a provides for the limits of the continental shelf which will be altered
in accordance with the agreement in force on the matter between Malaysia
and a country with an opposite or adjacent coast. The new section 2b is a
restatement of Article 76(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) and (10) of the UNCLOS
1982 pertaining to the delineation of the continental shelf between Malaysia
and other countries.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 3 to provide that if Malaysia does not_
undertake to exercise the rights with respect to the exploration of the continental
shelf or the exploitation of its natural resources, no one or no other country
may exercise such rights except with the express consent of Malaysia.

6. Clause 5 seeks to amend section 4 in order to empower the Minister to
terminate any licence issued under Act 83 and to increase penalty for any
offence under subsection (7).


-----

6 _Bill_

7. Clause 6 seeks to introduce a new section 4a to provide for payment and
contribution in respect of the exploitation of the non-living resources of the
continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles in accordance with Article 82 of
the UNCLOS 1982.

8. _Clause 7_ seeks to increase penalty for breaches of any regulations.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
