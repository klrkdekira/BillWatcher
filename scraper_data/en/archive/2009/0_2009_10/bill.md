omission or breach of duty against a council member, a supervisory

disposition took place, render the founder insolvent

void or voidable and the Labuan foundation shall be liable to
satisfy the creditor's claim to the extent of the interest that the
founder had in the property prior to the establishment, registration
or disposition, and any accumulation to the property, if any,

the time immediately after such establishment, registration or
disposition.

(3) In the event that the fair market value of the property referred
to in subsection (2) exceeded the value of the creditor's claim,

disposition shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed not to
have been so established or registered, or the property disposed
of, with principal intent to defraud the creditor.

takes place after the expiration of two years from the

of action accruing; or

_(b)_ the founder is a beneficiary.

(6) Where a Labuan foundation is liable to satisfy a creditor's
claim in the manner provided for in subsection (1) but is unable

disposition shall be void.

(7) For the purposes of this section, the date of the cause of
action accruing shall be—

to a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit or to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding six months or to both.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Labuan Foundations Act 2009 (”the Act”) as proposed by this Bill seeks
to provide for the establishment, regulation and dissolution of foundations in
Labuan and for matters relating to it. The concept of foundation is a legally
recognised concept in civil law countries as the civil law system recognises
the concept of contractual duties but not of the fiduciary duties and equity
as opposed to common law system. Therefore, the Act will cater to entities
that relate to civil law origins and making Labuan entities more acceptable
in both common and civil law systems.
