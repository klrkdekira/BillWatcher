_Town and Country Planning (Amendment)_ 3

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (“Act 172”).

2. Clause 1 seeks to provide for the short title, application and commencement
of the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to introduce a new section 20b into Act 172.

The proposed subsection 20b(1) seeks to impose a duty on every Federal

Government and State Government department or agency to seek advice from
the Council on a development proposal relating to any coastal reclamation
excluding reclamation for the construction of a jetty or beach rehabilitation,
and construction of a major national infrastructure including airports, seaports,
inland ports, railway transportation networks, highways, power stations, dams
and toxic waste disposal sites, and other infrastructure of national interest as
determined by the Council.

The duty to seek advice from the Council is imposed because of the

potential impacts of the development particularly on the environment, social
development and the economic development of the nation and States. At the
national level, the Council will be able to give advice on the development
proposals within the framework of the national policy in particular in terms
of the coordination between the States and optimization of the use of natural
resources and finance. This duty is consistent with the duty imposed on the
State Planning Committee under the existing subsections 22(2a) and (2b) of
Act 172.

The proposed subsection 20b(2) seeks to require the Federal Government

and State Government department or agency to submit to the Council the
development proposal together with a social impact assessment report and other
reports as determined by the Council for the purpose of seeking the advice
from the Council under the proposed subsection 20b(1). The requirement for
the social impact assessment report and other reports to be submitted to the
Council is to enable the Council to give proper advice on the development
proposal based on the reports made.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend section 21a of Act 172. Subclause 3(a) seeks to_
introduce a new paragraph 21a(ea) into Act 172 to require that the content of
a development proposal report to also include the analysis of and mitigation
measures for social impact and other impacts as determined by the local
planning authority. The analysis of and mitigation measures for social impact
and other impacts are essential to ensure that the development proposal is
prepared after taking into account the needs of the local population and the
negative social impact on the local population.

_Subclause 3(b) seeks to delete the existing subsection 21a(1a) of Act 172 to_

remove the discretionary power of the State Authority in requiring an analysis
of the social implications to be included in a development proposal report. This
proposed amendment is in consequence of the amendment in _subclause 3(a)._

of which cannot at present be ascertained.
