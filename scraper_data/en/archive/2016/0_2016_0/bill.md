and administer a fund known as the “Compensation Fund”.

Sabah Law Society instead of the Chief Judge to make rules.

26. _Clause 30 seeks to introduce the Second Schedule into the Ordinance._

The Second Schedule is in relation to the control of property of an advocate
who has been declared a bankrupt or is mentally disordered, etc., as provided
under the new section 16b or in relation to a deceased advocate whose personal
representatives are liable for the advocate’s acts as provided under the new
