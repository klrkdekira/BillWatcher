EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976
(“Act 164”) generally as one of the measures to address issues arising out of
the conversion to Islam of one party to a marriage.

This Bill seeks to give the right to the converting spouse to file a petition

for divorce to dissolve his civil marriage under subsection 51(1) of Act 164.
Currently, the law does not give the spouse who has converted to Islam the
right to file a petition for divorce in civil court under Act 164 as the right
to dissolve the marriage is only given to the spouse who has not converted
to Islam. Therefore, so long as the spouse who has not converted to Islam
does not file a petition for divorce in the civil court, the civil marriage of
the spouses is deemed to be valid and continuous under Act 164.

Since the spouse who has converted to Islam does not have the right to

file a petition for divorce under Act 164, he does not have the right to make
an application for other ancillary relief such as maintenance, custody of
children, division of matrimonial assets and etc. This situation causes hardship
to the converting spouse since Act 164 does not provide remedies for them
and some of them seek to find other remedies by filing an application for a
divorce and other ancillary relief in the Syariah Court. In that situation, the
Syariah Court will exercise its power to make an order in relation to divorce
and other ancillary relief. A conflict will arise where both spouses make an
application in two different courts i.e. the civil court and the Syariah Court
and both Courts make different orders.

Although the Syariah Court can grant an order for a divorce and ancillary

relief, it does not dissolve the civil marriage under Act 164 because the power
to dissolve the civil marriage under Act 164 is only given to the civil court.
Therefore, Syariah Court does not have jurisdiction to dissolve the marriage
and make order for other ancillary relief and such order for a divorce and
other ancillary relief have no legal effect. This matter has been decided by
the Federal Court in the case of Viran a/l Nagapan v. Deepa a/p Subramaniam

[Civil Appeal No. : 02(f)-4-01-2015(N)], Peguam Negara Malaysia and Ketua
Polis Negara v. Deepa a/p Subramaniam [Civil Appeal No. : N-02-801-05-2004 &
N-02-1004-06-2014], Subashini a/p Rajasingam v. Saravanan a/l Thangatoray &
other appeals [2008] 2 MLJ 147 and Tang Sung Mooi v. Too Miew Kim [1994]
3 MLJ 117 and by the High Court in the case of Shamala a/p Sathiyaseelan
v. Dr. Jeyaganesh a/l C. Mogarajah [2004] 2 MLJ 241, Kung Lim Siew (P)
v. Choong Chee Kuan [2003] 6 MLJ 260 and Teh Siew Choo v. Teo Eng Hua

[1999] 6 CLJ 308.

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and provision on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend subsection 3(3) of Act 164 to enable a party to_
a marriage who has converted to Islam or both parties to present a petition
for divorce before a civil court under Act 164. At present, the right to present
a petition for divorce is only given to the party who has not converted to
Islam. Those who have converted to Islam cannot apply for divorce under
Islamic Family Law Act/Enactment because the Syariah Court does not have
jurisdiction to hear any case where a non-muslim is involved.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend subsection 12(1) of Act 164 to confer equal_
rights in giving consent for marriage to the mother or adopted mother of a
person below 21 years of age, similar to that given to the father.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend subsection 51(1) of Act 164 to enable a party_
to a marriage who has converted to Islam or both parties to present a petition
for divorce.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to introduce a new section 51a of Act 164 to ensure that_
the next-of-kin of the person converting to Islam who subsequently dies before
the non-Muslim marriage is dissolved shall be entitled to the matrimonial
assets. In making the distribution, the court shall have regard to the extent
of the contributions made towards acquisition of the assets, debts owing, the
duration of the marriage and the needs of children.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to amend section 76 to allow the court to have regard_
to the payment of expenses for the benefit of the family, the extent of the
contributions made by the other party who did not acquire the assets to the
welfare of the family by looking after the home or caring for the family
and the duration of the marriage, for the purposes of equality of division of
matrimonial assets.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 88a into Act 164 to provide_
for the status of the religion of the child if his father or mother converts to
Islam.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 95 of Act 164 to extend the duration of_
the order for maintenance where a child is pursuing further or higher education
or training.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to provide for the transitional provision in relation to_

any existing actions or proceedings which commenced immediately before
the commencement of this Act in which such existing actions or proceedings
shall be continued under the provisions of the principal Act as amended by
this Act.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
