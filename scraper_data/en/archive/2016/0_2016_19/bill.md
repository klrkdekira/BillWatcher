EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

The Forest Research Institute Malaysia Bill 2016 (“the proposed Act”) seeks
to provide for the continued existence of the Forest Research Institute of
Malaysia with a change of name in the English language to the “Forest Research
Institute Malaysia” (“the Institute”). The Forest Research Institute of Malaysia
was established by the Malaysian Forestry Research and Development Board
(“the Board”) under the Malaysian Forestry Research and Development Board
Act 1985. With the coming into operation of the proposed Act, the Board will
be dissolved and the Institute will undertake the functions and powers of the
Board. For the better performance of its functions, the proposed Act seeks to
provide for the Institute to be a body corporate.

Being a research institution in the development of the forestry sector both
upstream and downstream, the Institute has conducted various researches
which have resulted in numerous research findings. At present, the research
findings are not being commercialized by the Institute but by the companies
appointed by the Institute. The Institute is collecting royalty of only three to
five percent from these companies. Hence, the proposed Act empowers the
Institute itself to commercialize these findings. Through commercialization,
the Institute will be able to generate its own income. The Institute aims to
self-sustain at least thirty percent of its operational cost, thus reducing its
reliance on Government funding.


-----

_Forest Research Institute Malaysia_ 35

To strengthen the command of the Institute, the proposed Act also seeks to
allow the Institute to act as a testing and certification body for forest produce.
The Institute intends to provide this facility to both the local and international
forest-based industry.

For many years the Institute has been a referral centre to university students
who seek the Institute’s assistance to co-supervise their research for postgraduate
studies and the Institute provides such assistance at no cost. With the proposed
Act, the Institute is empowered to offer technical and non-technical courses
or training and subsequently to confer certificates upon persons who have
followed such courses or training. The proposed Act further allows the Institute
to collaborate with any institution or organization within or outside Malaysia.
