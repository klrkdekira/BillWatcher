EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill (“the proposed Act”) seeks to amend the Bankruptcy Act 1967
(“Act 360”). The proposed Act seeks, among others, to strengthen the provisions
relating to guarantor and social guarantor, to raise the minimum debt threshold
for the filing of a bankruptcy petition, to introduce another type of discharge
namely automatic discharge, to strengthen the provisions relating to service of
bankruptcy notice and creditors petition, to introduce a pre-bankruptcy rescue
mechanism, to introduce a single order for bankruptcy namely “bankruptcy

34 _Bill_

order” to replace the two-tier order system namely “receiving order and
adjudication order”, to establish the Insolvency Assistance Fund and to provide
for other miscellaneous and consequential matters.

2. Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act and seeks to empower
the Minister to appoint the date of coming into operation of the proposed Act.

3. Clause 2 seeks to amend the long title of Act 360 to explain that Act 360
contains provisions relating to insolvency and bankruptcy of individual. The
proposed Act seeks to introduce a new rescue mechanism called the voluntary
arrangement at the option of the insolvent debtor before a bankruptcy order
is made by the court against him. This amendment is also a reflection to the
international standard practice among developed countries such as the United
Kingdom and Singapore where their laws on bankruptcy contain similar
provisions on voluntary arrangement. Further, this clause seeks to harmonize
the amendment made in 2003 to change the name of the Official Assignee to
the Director General of Insolvency. Consequently, the short title of Act 360
is to be amended by _clause 4._

4. Clause 3 seeks to provide for a general amendment to substitute for the
word “receiving” the word “bankruptcy” and for the word “debtor” the word
“bankrupt” in consequence of the introduction of a single order for bankruptcy
into Act 360.

5. Clause 5 seeks to provide that any reference to the Bankruptcy Act 1967
in any written law or document shall, after the proposed Act comes into
operation, be construed as references to the Insolvency Act 1967.

6. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 360 to introduce new definition
and to amend certain existing definition.

7. Clause 7 seeks to amend the heading of Part I to explain that Part I contains
provisions relating to voluntary arrangement and proceeding in bankruptcy.

8. Clause 8 seeks to introduce new sections 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, 2g, 2h,
2i, 2j, 2k, 2l, 2m, 2n, 2o, 2p and 2q into Act 360. The proposed new section
2a seeks to introduce the term “voluntary arrangement” into Act 360. The
proposed new section 2b seeks to provide that provisions relating to voluntary
arrangement shall not apply to an undischarged bankrupt and a limited liability
partnership within the meaning of the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2012

[Act 743].

The proposed new section 2c seeks to provide that a debtor may, at any

time before he is adjudged bankrupt, propose a voluntary arrangement and
for the purpose of the proposal debtor shall appoint a nominee and make an
application to the court for an interim order for voluntary arrangement.

The proposed new sections 2d and 2e seek to provide for the power of the

court to make an interim order and the effect of such interim order.


-----

_Bankruptcy (Amendment)_ 35

The proposed new sections 2f, 2g and 2h seek to detail out the persons

who may act as a nominee, the registration of a nominee and the duty of the
Director General of Insolvency to keep and maintain a register of nominees.

The proposed new sections 2i, 2j, 2k and 2l seek to provide for the duty of

a nominee to conduct a meeting of creditors to approve the proposed voluntary
arrangement pursuant to the interim order made by the court and to provide
for actions required to be taken at the conclusion of the meeting.

The proposed new section 2m seeks to allow the debtor to replace an existing

nominee and seeks to provide for the effect of the replacement on the period
of interim order and for the carrying out of duties of the previous nominee.

The proposed new section 2n seeks to provide that a nominee shall supervise

the implementation of the voluntary arrangement once it is approved by the
creditors. Further, the proposed new section empowers parties to the voluntary
arrangement to apply for a court review of any act, omission or decision by
the nominee during the implementation of the voluntary arrangement.

The proposed new sections 2o and 2p seek to provide for the consequence

of failure by the debtor to comply with voluntary arrangement and to provide
for cessation of voluntary arrangement.

The proposed new section 2q seeks to empower the Minister to prescribe the

scale of fees to be charged by nominees so that appropriate fees are charged
in respect of voluntary arrangement.

9. Clause 9 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 360 to provide for the manner
of service of a bankruptcy notice.

10. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend section 4 of Act 360 to empower the court

to make a bankruptcy order upon presentation of a bankruptcy petition either
by a creditor or by a debtor.

11. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 5 of Act 360 to increase the minimum_

debt threshold for the filing of a bankruptcy petition from thirty thousand
ringgit to fifty thousand ringgit. This clause further provides that a creditor is
not entitled to commence bankruptcy proceedings against a social guarantor.
In relation to a guarantor other than a social guarantor, a creditor may not
commence bankruptcy proceedings unless the creditor has obtained leave from
the court.

12. _Clause 13 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 360 to provide for the manner_

of service of a creditor’s petition.

13. _Clause 14 seeks to amend section 7 of Act 360 to clarify that the court_

shall not adjudge a member of a firm bankrupt unless that person is proved
to be a partner by his admission or evidence on oath.


-----

36 _Bill_

14. _Clause 15 seeks to amend section 8 of Act 360 to provide for the effect_

of a bankruptcy order consequential to the deletion of section 24.

15. _Clause 16 seeks to delete section 9 of Act 360 to be consistent with the_

single order system.

16. _Clause 17_ seeks to amend section 12 of Act 360 to prohibit a debtor

from being appointed as a special manager.

17. _Clause 18_ seeks to delete section 14 of Act 360 to be consistent with

the single order system.

18. _Clause 21_ seeks to amend section 16 of Act 360 to be consistent with

the single order system. The existing section 16 requires submission of the
statement of affairs during the receiving order stage, but under this amendment,
the statement of affairs is submitted to the Director General of Insolvency
after the making of a bankruptcy order against a debtor.

19. _Clause 23_ seeks to amend section 17 of Act 360 to be consistent with

the single order system, so that the court conducts public examination of a
bankrupt after he is adjudged bankrupt. The existing section 17 allows for
public examination of a debtor during the receiving order stage.

20. _Clause 24 seeks to amend section 18 of Act 360 in relation to composition_

or scheme of arrangement of a bankrupt’s affairs. The existing section 18
gives power to creditors to accept a proposal for a composition or scheme
of arragement by a debtor during the receiving order stage, while section
26, which is similar to section 18, allows for a composition or scheme of
arragement to be proposed by a bankrupt after his adjudication. However, since
the amendment seeks to introduce a single order for bankruptcy, there is no
longer composition or scheme under the receiving order stage and therefore,
section 18 is amended to cater for proposal of a composition or scheme by a
bankrupt after his adjudication. A provision is also inserted in section 18 to
confer power to the court to annul a bankruptcy order once the court approves
a composition or scheme which has been accepted by the creditors.

21. _Clause 25_ seeks to delete sections 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of Act 360.

Section 19 is deleted since the effect of composition or scheme under this section
is no longer applicable at the bankruptcy order stage and as a consequential
amendment in relation to the introduction of a single order for bankruptcy.
Section 20 on registration of deeds of arrangements is deleted and therefore
sections 21 to 23 are deleted as consequential amendments to the deletion of
section 20.

22. _Clause 27 seeks to delete section 24 of Act 360 as a result of the_

introduction of a single order for bankruptcy and to delete section 26 of Act 360
in relation to a composition or scheme of arrangement after the adjudication
order as elements of this provision is incorporated in section 18 of Act 360.

23. _Clauses 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34,_ and 35 seek to amend sections 27,

28, 29, 31, 32, 33 and 33a of Act 360 respectively as a consequence of the
introduction of a single order for bankruptcy.


-----

_Bankruptcy (Amendment)_ 37

24. _Clause 31 seeks to amend section 30 of Act 360 as the mode of redirecting_

letters by way of telegrams is no longer relevant.

25. _Clause 36 seeks to amend section 33b of Act 360 to list out categories of_

bankrupt persons against whom no objection shall be made to their discharge
under section 33a of Act 360.

26. _Clause 37_ seeks to introduce a new section 33c into Act 360 to provide

for another type of discharge namely automatic discharge. Pursuant to this
new section, a bankrupt shall be discharged from bankruptcy after three years
from the date of the submission of his statement of affairs subject to the
condition that the bankrupt has achieved the target contribution determined by
the Director General of Insolvency, objection by creditors and the bankrupt’s
compliance with the requirement to render an account of moneys and property.

27. _Clauses 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46 are amendments consequential_

to the introduction of a single order for bankruptcy.

28. _Clause 47 seeks to amend section 77 of Act 360 to provide that the_

profit and dividend from the investment of surplus fund shall be credited to
the Insolvency Assistance Fund established under the new section 77a.

29. _Clause 48_ seeks to introduce a new section 77a into Act 360 to provide

for the establishment of the Insolvency Assistance Fund which is to be
administered and controlled by the Director General of Insolvency for the
purposes of achieving the betterment of the administration and proceedings
relating to bankruptcy.

30. _Clauses 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54_ and 55 seek to amend sections 84a, 104,

105, 106, 108, 109 and 114 of Act 360 respectively as a consequence of the
introduction of a single bankruptcy order.

31. _Clause 56_ seeks to amend section 134 of Act 360 as a consequential

amendment to the amendment of section 18 of Act 360.

32. _Clause 59_ seeks to delete Schedule B of Act 360 as a consequential

amendment to the deletion of section 20.

33. _Clause 60_ contains the saving provision.

34. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor

or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
