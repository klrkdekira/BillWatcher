EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

1. Paragraph 1 seeks to amend clause 1 of this Bill to provide for the commencement

of clause 4A on the application of Act 501 to the State of Sarawak.

2. Paragraph 2 seeks to introduce a new section 1A into Act 501 to provide for the

manner of application of Act 501 to the State of Sarawak. Act 501 came into operation

on 17 July 1997 throughout Malaysia including the State of Sarawak. However, Act 501

has never been enforced in the State of Sarawak where instead the Sarawak Gas Supply

Services (Operating Company) Ordinance, 1995 has been in operation since

30 November 1995 in the State of Sarawak. The Sarawak Gas Supply Services

(Operating Company) Ordinance, 1995 was enacted pursuant to the Borneo States


-----

(Legislative Powers) Order 1963 [L.N. 17/63], made by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong under

Article 95C of the Federal Constitution, read together with Article 76A of the Federal

Constitution.

Thus for the purpose of regularising the non-application of Act 501 to the State of

Sarawak, a new subclause 4A(2) is introduced into this Bill in this Amendment in

Committee. The new subclause 4A(2) seeks to provide that the application of Act 501

is deemed to be suspended for the State of Sarawak. However, upon obtaining the prior

approval of the State of Sarawak on the application of Act 501, the Minister shall have the

power to appoint a date of the coming into operation of Act 501 for the State of Sarawak

pursuant to the new section 1A of Act 501.

3. The proposed amendments in paragraphs 3 and 4 are for the purpose of

consistency between the national language text and the English language text.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Gas Supply Act 1993 (“Act 501”) primarily to
enable the Commission to regulate the economic aspect in the licensing of
the import into regasification terminal, regasification, shipping, transportation,
distribution, retail or use in the supply of gas to consumers through pipelines
and related matters, the supply of gas at reasonable prices, the control of
gas supply pipelines, installations and appliances and with respect to matters
relating to safety of persons in the distribution, retail or use of gas, to regulate
competition practices and for purposes connected therewith.

2. _Clause 1_ contains the short title and provisions on the commencement
and application of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2_ contains amendments to the long title of Act 501.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to make general amendments to Act 501 in the English
text by replacing the words “shall be guilty of” with the word “commits” to
be in line with the latest drafting on penalty provision and to substitute the
word “installation” with the words “piping system” except for subsections
12(8), 20(3), 20(4), 30(1) and 36(1).

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend subsections 1(3) and (4) of Act 501 to enable_
the Commission to extend its regulation to activities related to the import
into regasification terminal, regasification, shipping and transportation of gas
besides the downstream activities of distribution, retail or use in the supply
of gas to consumers, through pipelines and piping system. In addition, a new


-----

_Gas Supply (Amendment)_ 83

subsection 1(3a) is introduced into Act 501 to provide for safety and technical
regulation in distribution, retail or use of gas only. Currently, there are three
sources of natural gas supply to Malaysia as follows:

(i) liquefied natural gas through regasification terminal;

(ii) natural gas through gas processing plant and onshore gas terminal;

and

(iii) natural gas through Trans Thailand-Malaysia pipeline

The scope of the proposed Act therefore includes the three sources as stipulated
in the amended and new subsections. This arrangement would accelerate market
growth and promote competition in the gas market.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 501 to introduce a number of_
new definitions into Act 501 and to amend several existing definitions used
in Act 501.

7. _Clause 6 seeks to substitute section 4 of Act 501 to provide more_
comprehensive and effective functions and duties of the Commission and to
enable the Commission to promote growth, efficiency and competition in the
domestic gas market. This would ensure a reliable and sustainable gas market
in the country.

8. Clause 7 seeks to substitute section 4a of Act 501 to state clearly the
powers of an authorized officer.

9. _Clause 8_ seeks to amend section 5 of Act 501 to empower an
authorized officer to investigate any infringement on prohibition or offence
under Act 501.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to substitute section 6 of Act 501 to extend the power_

of authorized officers of the Commission to exercise the special powers in
relation to police investigation relating to any infringement under Act 501
