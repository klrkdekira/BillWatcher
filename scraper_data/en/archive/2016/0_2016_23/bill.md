EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the National Land Code (“the Code”).

2. _Clause_ _1 contains the short title and provisions on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 5 of the Code to introduce the new_
definition of subdivided building into the Code and to substitute the law
referred to in the definition of “territorial waters” to state the current law in
operation regarding the matter that is the Territorial Sea Act 2012.

4. _Clause_ _3 seeks to amend section 5d of the Code to enable the issuance_
of lease of reserved land to be made in accordance with the Electronic Land
Administration System under the Sixteenth Schedule to the Code. Consequential
amendment to the Sixteenth Schedule of the Code will be made by the
Minister with the approval of the National Land Council, in accordance with
section 5d of the Code.

28 _Bill_

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 14 of the Code to enable the State_
Authority to make provisions in the State Land Rules relating to refund and
forfeiture of any deposit paid as security for the issuance of licence and permit
under section 68a or 74 of the Code respectively. This amendment also seeks
to facilitate the collection of rents through any appointed agent without having
to provide under the State Land Rules which is consistent with the amendment
to section 95 of the Code. This provision was previously included in section 14
_vide Act A1333._

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 15 of the Code to enable the Director_
of Lands and Mines, the Registrar of Titles and the Land Administrator to
issue notice in Form 2b to require production of documents not only for the
purpose of inspection or standardisation of express conditions or restriction in
interest, but also for any other purposes. Consequential amendment to Form
2b in the First Schedule of the Code will be made by the Minister on the
recommendation of the National Land Council, in accordance with section 9
of the Code.

7. _Clause_ _6 seeks to amend section 16 of the Code to clarify that any_
actions, suits or other proceedings relating to land shall be brought against the
Director of Lands and Mines in the name of his office, without naming any
particular officer. This proposed amendment is necessary due to the decision
of the Federal Court in the case of Kerajaan Malaysia & Ors. v Lay Kee Tee
& Ors. [2009] 1 MLJ 1.

8. _Clause_ _7 seeks to amend section 42 of the Code to make general references_
to the current law being in operation relating to mining. Although most of
the states have enforced the Mineral Enactment, the Mining Enactment is still
being used in certain states.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend section 43 of the Code to update the references_
to the laws currently in operation relating to the diplomatic and consular
matters as well as international organizations.

10. _Clause 9_ seeks to amend section 46a of the Code to provide that in the

11. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 66 of the Code to provide that the_

officer to be referred to by the Land Administrator in processing applications
for Temporary Occupation Licence on mining land is the Director of Mines
as appointed under the written law relating to mineral development. The post
of Senior Inspector of Mines no longer referred to in the current legislation.

This proposed amendment also seeks to improve the provision in its application

to the proviso to subsection 13(1) of the Code which does not authorize the
Land Administrator to approve licences in and within fifty metres from any
shore, lake and spring which have been gazetted.


-----

_National Land Code (Amendment)_ 29

12. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend section 68a of the Code to make provision

for the State Authority to collect deposits as security for due performance and
observance of the conditions for Temporary Occupation Licence.

13. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 71 of the Code to provide that the_

officer to be referred to by the Land Administrator in processing applications
for permits to extract, remove and transport rock materials on mining land is
the Director of Mines as appointed under the written law relating to mineral
development. The post of Senior Inspector of Mines is no longer referred to
in the current legislation.

This proposed amendment is also made to streamline this provision with the

proviso to subsection 13(1) of the Code which does not authorize the Land
Administrator to approve permits in and within 50 metres from any shore,
lake and spring which have been gazetted.

14. _Clause 13_ seeks to amend section 75c of the Code to provide that upon

approval of application under section 75b of the Code, other than the Land
Administrator, any officer authorized by the State Authority may issue on
behalf of the State Authority, a permit in Form 4d.

15. _Clause_ _14 seeks to amend subsection 80(3a) of the Code which was_

introduced into the Code _vide Act A1333 to provide that the Registrar may,_
upon approval of alienation of any land, register the final title without issuing
the qualified title if it appears to be just and expedient to do so.

16. _Clause_ _15 seeks to introduce a new section 90a into the Code to provide_

for the procedure and process for applications of extension of land alienated
for a term of years, at any time, before the period expires. However, the
approval is subject to the discretion of the State Authority. If approved, the
endorsement as to the extension of the tenure of the title shall only be made
after the payment has been cleared. In such a case, unless the payment is
made, in the event of the land being subjected to acquisition, subparagraph
1(1d) of the First Schedule to the Land Acquisition Act is still applicable.

17. _Clause_ _16 seeks to amend section 92c of the Code to make provision for_

the Registrar to issue qualified title upon alienation of underground State land
before issuing final title (in the form of Registry title) if it appears to be just
and expedient to do so and the Minister may by order, make modifications to
the forms for qualified title corresponding to the Registry title.

18. _Clause 17_ seeks to amend section 92d of the Code to provide that the

depth of the surface land of the proprietor as approved by the State Authority is
to be endorsed as an express condition to that title. This proposed amendment
also clarifies that endorsement relating to depth in a title in the case of final
title may also refer to a plan issued by the Director of Survey and Mapping.

19. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 95 of the Code to expand the places_

and mechanism for payment of rents.


-----

30 _Bill_

20. _Clause_ _19_ seeks to introduce a new section 96a into the Code to make

provision for the imposition of rents in respect of titles with subdivided
building under the Strata Titles Act 1985 when Part IVa of the Act comes
into operation, in which case the rents of the land will no longer be collected
and enforcement for failure to pay rent must be made based on the provision
of the Strata Titles Act 1985. Upon the termination of subdivided building,
the rent in respect of the land shall become payable beginning of the next
following calendar year according to the prevailing rate being in force then
as a result of revision carried out from time to time under section 101 of the
Code.

21. _Clause_ _20 seeks to introduce new subsections 101(7) and (8) into the_

Code to provide that the revision of rents in respect of land with subdivided
building will still be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code
even though Part IVa of the Strata Titles Act 1985 is in operation.

The proposed new subsections also clarify that a new rate based on the

revision shall be endorsed in the title. However, the rent of the land is not
payable until the subdivision of the building is terminated. Only then the rent
of the land becomes payable as indicated under the proposed new section 96a.

22. _Clause_ _21_ seeks to amend section 122 of the Code to clarify that more

than one land use for any building may be imposed in the condition by the
State Authority. This clarification is necessary since more than one land use
may be specified in respect of alienation of underground land pursuant to
subsection 92b(1) of the Code.

23. _Clause_ _22 seeks to amend section 124 of the Code for the following_

purposes:

_(a)_ to amend the proviso to subsection (1) to restrict any application for

variation of conditions for titles having been endorsed with depth
limit, since the land underneath is State land;

_(b)_ to ensure the endorsement is made once application is submitted in

accordance with the new proposed subsection (1b); and

_(c)_ to ensure that payment had been made before the new condition is

endorsed in the title, as amended under subsection (7).

24. _Clause_ _23_ seeks to amend section 160b of the Code to make provision

for actions to be taken by the Land Administrator when a new district is
created, for the matter involving titles for land with subdivided building. note
relating to creation of the new district must be made on the subsidiary register
(whereby under section 5 of the Code includes the strata register as defined
under the Strata Titles Act 1985) by the Land Administrator who maintains
these documents in the former district. The strata register under the Strata Titles
Act 1985 which refers to section 15 (as amended _vide Act A1450 comprises_
of Form 2, Form 3 and titles in Form 4 and Form 4a in the First Schedule
to that Act). All of these documents must be kept in the former district.

This proposed amendment also seeks to clarify that the strata register which

has been endorsed cannot be removed from the former Land Office.

_National Land Code (Amendment)_ 31

25. _Clause_ _24 seeks to amend section 160c of the Code to clarify the_

issuance of title in continuation in respect of land with subdivided building
when a new district is created. The Land Administrator of the new district
is required to issue title in continuation for all parcels held under subsidiary
titles (including strata titles) comprised in the titles involved in such exercise.
The Land Administrator is also required to reestablish the respective Form 2
and Form 3 in the First Schedule to the Strata Titles Act 1985 in accordance
with the particulars of the title thereby continued.

26. _Clause_ _25 seeks to amend section 166 of the Code to enable the issuance_

of title in continuation due to partial acquisition which relates to whole or
part of the underground land and subsection 92b(2) of the Code applies for
issuance of such title in continuation.

27. _Clause_ _26_ seeks to amend paragraph 170 of the Code to clarify that

in the case of title in continuation, the issue documents of title in respect
of strata titles can also be produced in accordance with the Strata Titles Act
1985 after the issuance of the register documents of title in continuation.

This proposed amendment also seeks to clarify that title in continuation

involving subsidiary title under Strata Titles Act 1985 also include Form 4a,
in accordance with section 15 of that Act as amended _vide Act A1450._

This proposed amendment further seeks to enable the Registrar to endorse

particulars of the title in continuation in the respective strata register kept
in his office if it involves title with subdivided building. In this case, it is
sufficient for the Registrar to note in Form 2 and Form 3 and the register
document in Form 4 or Form 4a in the First Schedule to the Strata Titles Act
1985, as the case may be, to note that the main title has been continued.

28. _Clause 27_ seeks to amend section 175f of the Code to provide that the

issue document of title or the strata register issued by the Registrar or Land
Administrator under this section shall be in the form appropriate under the
Code and Strata Titles Act 1985.

29. _Clause_ _28_ seeks to amend section 183a which was introduced into

the Code _vide Act A1104 to provide that the Registrar may, after approval_
of subdivisions, register final titles, without first issuing the qualified titles
even though applications have been made for issuance of qualified titles, if
it appears just and expedient to do so.

30. _Clause_ _29 seeks to amend section 184a which was introduced into the_

Code vide Act A1104 to provide that Registrar may, after approval of partition,
register final titles without first issuing the qualified titles even though
applications have been made for issuance of qualified titles, if it appears just
and expedient to do so.

31. _Clause_ _30 seeks to amend section 185a which was introduced into the_

Code _vide Act A1104 to provide that the Registrar may, after approval of_
amalgamation, register final titles without first issuing the qualified titles
even though applications have been made for issuance of qualified titles, if
it appears just and expedient to do so.

32 _Bill_

32. _Clause_ _32_ seeks to amend section 204b of the Code to provide that in

relation to land held under qualified title, the application for surrender and
re-alienation may only be entertained if the land has been duly surveyed
and the application must also be accompanied with a certified plan approved
by the Director of Survey and Mapping unless the State Authority directs
otherwise.

33. _Clause 33_ seeks to amend section 204d of the Code to streamline the

terms used to be in line with other provisions in the Code.

34. _Clause 34 seeks to introduce a new subsection 204e(3a) into the Code_

to enable the State Authority to approve re-alienation for a term of years
(leasehold period) although the original title is held in perpetuity, on the
application of the proprietor (particularly land held by the Federal Government
involves in privatisation). Taking into consideration the decision of the Federal
Court in _Pengarah Tanah dan Galian, Wilayah Persekutuan v. Sri Lempah_
_Enterprise Sdn Bhd_ [1979] 1 MLJ 135, the State Authority can approve such
changes of tenure only by the application of the proprietor. In the case where
the title of the land is held for a term of years, the State Authority may
approve for re-alienation for a longer term if it is also being considered under
section 90a. The State Authority may also determine the periods for the land
to be realienated if the periods in the original titles are different, as long
as the proprietor is not given a less favourable term from the one currently
enjoyed by him.

This proposed amendment also seeks to streamline the terms used with

other provisions in the Code. In addition, this proposed amendment seeks to
clarify that the State Authority may decide to alienate State land adjoining to
the land owned by the applicant.

35. _Clause_ _35 seeks to amend section 204g of the Code to provide that a_

memorial on the reversion of land to the State in the register document of
title shall be made only after full payment is made in accordance with Form
5a and the issue document of title will then be destroyed consequently. When
section 204ga applies, the memorial for reversion will only be made after
subsisting charge, if any, is discharged.

36. _Clause_ _36_ seeks to amend section 204ga of the Code to provide that

the acceptance of the proprietor upon the approval by the State Authority
pursuant to section 204e in respect of title subjected to a charge shall include
the consent by the chargee as to discharge of the charge and for a fresh charge
to be executed on the realienated land. It implies that such consent shall not
be necessary if the repayment for the financing secured by the charge has
been made in full prior to the approval of the State Authority, leading to its
discharge.

37. _Clause_ _38_ seeks to amend section 214a to provide that the document

to be submitted to enable the Registrar to register any transfer of estate land
is the written approval of the State Authority, in the case where the State
Authority approves the appeal against the decision of the Estate Land Board
pursuant to subsection 214a(9) of the Code.


-----

_National Land Code (Amendment)_ 33

_Clause 38 also seeks to amend subsections 214a(10) and (10a) of the_

or to both.

the financial institutions which comply with syariah principles may create

laws.

39. _Clause_ _40 seeks to amend section 254 of the Code to provide that the_

alternative period in Form 16d shall not be less than one month, to tally with
the provision of subsection 254(1) of the Code.

40. _Clause_ _41 seeks to amend section 281 of the Code to enable lien to be_

created as security and not necessarily for loans.

41. _Clause_ _42 seeks to introduce a new section 292a into the Code to_

provide that the Minister, with the approval of the National Land Council, by
order, to make such modifications relating to any provisions of this Code to
facilitate lodgement of instrument electronically. Such order may cover matters
such as actions to be taken by the Registrar during the pre-registration and
post-registration in respect of such presentations and forms to be used (in
lieu of the forms provided in the First Schedule to the Code). Such order
may also cover matters currently governed by the provisions of the Tenth
Schedule to the Code.

42. _Clause_ _44_ seeks to introduce new subsections 305(2a) and (2b) into the

Code to enable the return of any document after registration of any instrument
of dealing is made by the person or body who collects the document upon
being notified accordingly. Fees as provided under the State Land Rules will
be imposed if it is not collected within the period given.

This proposed amendment also seeks to clarify that in the case where title

in continuation has been issued consequent to the creation of a new district,
the requirement in respect of endorsement of any documents kept by the
former district shall be carried out by the Registrar of the former district.

43. _Clause_ _45 seeks to amend subsection 323(2) of the Code to clarify that_

53. _Clauses_ _58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69 and 70 seek to increase_

and streamline the penalty for offences specified under sections 400, 400a,
403, 422, 423, 424, 425, 425a, 426, 427, 428 and 428a respectively. Clause 61
also seeks to enable the punishment to be meted out either in the form of
fine or imprisonment or to both.

54. _Clause_ _67 seeks to amend section 426a of the Code to confer power_

to the Land Administrator to stop and examine any vehicles or other things
for the purpose of enforcement under section 426 of the Code. The clause
also seeks to introduce a new subsection 426a(6) into the Code to provide
penalty for any person who refuses to cooperate with the authorized officer in
the exercise of his power under section 426a of the Code, where the penalty
imposed is a fine not more than five thousand ringgit and imprisonment for
a term of not more than six months or to both.

55. _Clause 71 seeks to amend section 429a of the Code to standardise the_

term used to be in line with other provisions in the Code.

56. _Clause_ _72 seeks to amend section 429b of the Code to streamline with_

provisions relating to compound in other laws. This proposed amendment also
to clarify that compoundable offences must be prescribed in the State Land
Rules, pursuant to paragraph 14(1)(ja) of the Code.

57. _Clause_ _73 seeks to amend section 431a of the Code to allow the Land_

Administrator to handle service involving proprietor who is dead, not confined
only to the Registrar which refers to the Registrar of Titles for registry title
and Land Administrator for land office title. Therefore, substituted service may
be made without having to refer to the Registrar of Titles first, if it involves
registry title. For example, substituted service for notice in Forms 6a, 7a and
8a.

58. _Clause 74 seeks to amend section 432 of the Code to allow the Land_

Administrator to handle substituted service, not confined only to the Registrar
which refers to the Registrar of Titles for registry title and Land Administrator
for land office title. Therefore, substituted service may be made without
having to refer to the Registrar of Titles first, if it involves registry title. For
example, substituted service for notice in Forms 6a, 7a and 8a. This proposed
amendment also seeks to streamline the provisions relating to substituted
service with the provisions relating to publication of notices or notifications.

59. _Clause 75 seeks to amend section 433 of the Code to streamline the_

provisions relating to publication of notices or notifications with the provisions
relating to the substituted service as amended in _clause 71._

60. _Clause 76_ seeks to amend section 433a of the Code in relation to the

interpretation of certain provisions in view of the new law relating to companies.

61. _Clause_ _77 seeks to amend subsections 433b(1), (4) and (5) of the Code_

to clarify that the restrictions would also be imposed on land with the category
“industry” or land for industrial purposes, similar to the restrictions already
being imposed on land with category “agriculture” or “building” or land for
agriculture and building purposes.
