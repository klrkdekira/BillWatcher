EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1957
(“Act 299”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the provision on the commencement_
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 299 to introduce the definition_
of “Certificate of Presumed Death” into Act 299.


-----

_Births and Deaths Registration (Amendment)_ 15

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 4 of Act 299 to enable registers of
births, deaths and presumed deaths to be kept in a form to be determined by
the Registrar-General.

Currently, the registers of births, deaths and presumed deaths are kept and

maintained manually by the National Registration Department of Malaysia. At
the same time, the National Registration Department of Malaysia also implements
centralized registers relating to births, deaths and presumed deaths in the
form of computer databases. However, the National Registration Department
of Malaysia shall continue to keep and maintain manually the registers of
births, deaths and presumed deaths administratively. Consequential to the
implementation of centralized registers relating to births, deaths and presumed
deaths in the form of computer databases, several provisions of Act 299
have to be amended, specifically subsections 4(2) and (3), subsection 7(1),
subsection 18(1), section 26, subsections 27(3), (4) and (6) and section 30.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4a of Act 299 to enable re-registration of_
the death of any person whose records are for any reason missing or destroyed.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to amend section 6 of Act 299 to allow any public officer_
to inspect the registers and indices in the performance of his duties with the
authorization of the Registrar-General. The proposed amendment will facilitate
the sharing of information between government agencies.

7. _Clause 6_ seeks to amend section 7 of Act 299.

_Subclause 6(a)(i) seeks to amend subsection 7(1) of Act 299 to enable the_

registration of the birth of every child born in Peninsular Malaysia in any
registration area. Prior to the proposed amendment, each birth shall only be
registered in the area in which the birth occurred as all registers and indices
are kept manually at the Registrar’s office for the area where the birth
occurred. However, with the implementation of centralized registers in the
form of computer databases, all new registers are no longer required to be
kept manually by the Registrar. Consequently, the registration of birth of any
child may be done at any Registrar’s office in Peninsular Malaysia.

_Subclause 6(b) seeks to delete subsection 7(3) of Act 299. The deletion of_

subsection (3) of Act 299 seeks to remove the provision that permits Chinese
characters to be used in the registration of the birth of a Chinese child due to
the implementation of centralized registers in the form of computer databases
which only recognizes Roman characters.

8. _Clause 7_ seeks to amend section 8 of Act 299 to extend the period for
giving information concerning a birth to the Registrar from fourteen days to
sixty days. From 2003 to 2014, the statistic shows that two hundred sixty
nine thousand and seventy five cases for late registration of births have been
recorded. Therefore, in order to reduce such number of cases and to give more
time to a qualified person to register the birth of a child, the period for giving
information concerning the birth is proposed to be extended to sixty days.


-----

16 _Bill_

9. _Clause 8_ seeks to introduce a new section 10a into Act 299 to deal with
a special provision for registration of birth. Currently, there are instances
where registration of birth are done administratively as it cannot be done in
accordance with the existing provisions of Act 299, for example a birth aboard
an aircraft or ship and where it involves the jurisdiction of a foreign state.
Hence, the proposed amendment seeks to provide for an express provision
relating to the powers of the Registrar-General to register any birth if he is
satisfied from evidence adduced before him that such birth has occurred.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to delete section 11 of Act 299. The deletion of section 11_
of Act 299 is consequential to the amendment of section 8 of Act 299 in
_clause 7 which extends the period of giving information concerning a birth_
from fourteen days to sixty days.

11. _Clause 10_ seeks to amend section 12 of Act 299.

_Subclause 10(a)(i)_ seeks to amend subsection 12(1) of Act 299 to insert

provision on the requirement of written authority of the Registrar-General for
registration of a birth if the registration is made after the expiration of sixty
days from the date of birth. The proposed amendment is consequential to the
amendment of section 8 of Act 299 in _clause 7 which extends the period for_
giving information concerning a birth. The proposed amendment also seeks
to insert provision on the requirement of written authority of the RegistrarGeneral for registration of the birth of a living newborn child who is found
exposed if the registration is made after expiration of fourteen days from the
date when the child is found exposed, for the benefit and security of the child,
instead of forty-two days as in the existing provision.

_Subclause 10(a)(ii) seeks to amend subsection 12(1) of Act 299 to provide_

that late registration is subject to such fees and conditions prescribed by the
Minister.

_Subclause 10(b)_ seeks to introduce a new subsection 12(1a) into Act 299

to provide that the Registrar-General may waive the fees prescribed for late
registration, in whole or in part, subject to the criteria and conditions to be
determined by the Minister.

12. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend section 18 of Act 299.

_Subclause 11(a)_ seeks to amend section 18 of Act 299 to enable the death

of every person who died in Peninsular Malaysia to be registered by the
Registrar in any registration area. Prior to the proposed amendment, each
death shall only be registered in the area in which the death occurred as all
registers and indices are kept manually at the Registrar’s office for the area
where the death occurred. However, with the implementation of centralized
registers in the form of computer databases, all new registers are no longer
required to be kept manually by the Registrar. Consequently, the registration
of death may be done at any Registrar’s office in Peninsular Malaysia.

13. _Clause 12 seeks to amend section 19 of Act 299 to extend the period_

for giving information concerning a death to the Registrar from twelve hours
to seven days. Due to the needs, circumstances, rituals, religious obligations


-----

_Births and Deaths Registration (Amendment)_ 17

and customs with regard to the management of a death that may prevent a
qualified person from informing the death to the Registrar in a period of twelve
hours after the death, the period for giving information is extended to seven
days. Furthermore, from 2003 to 2014, the statistic shows that seventy two
thousand and nine hundred twenty nine cases for late registration of deaths
have been recorded. Therefore, in order to reduce such number of cases and
to give more time to a qualified person to register a death, the period for
giving information concerning the death is proposed to be extended to seven
days.

14. _Clause 13_ seeks to introduce a new section 19a into Act 299 to deal

with a special provision for registration of death in the wake of the MH17
incident where the deaths of its passengers cannot be registered in accordance
with the existing provisions of Act 299. Hence, the proposed amendment seeks
to provide for an express provision relating to the powers of the RegistrarGeneral to register any death if he is satisfied from evidence adduced before
him that such death has occurred.

15. _Clause 14 seeks to delete section 20 of Act 299. The deletion of section 20_

of Act 299 is consequential to the amendment of section 19 of Act 299 in
_clause 12 which extends the period of giving information concerning a death_
from twelve hours to seven days.

16. _Clause 15 seeks to amend section 21 of Act 299._

_Subclause 15(b)(i)_ seeks to amend section 21 of Act 299 to provide on

the requirement of written authority of the Registrar-General for registration
of a death if the registration is made after the expiration of seven days from
the date of the death or the date of finding the dead body. The proposed
amendment is consequential to the amendment of section 19 of Act 299 in
_clause 12 which extends the period of giving information concerning a death._

_Subclause 15(b)(iii) seeks to amend section 21 of Act 299 to provide that_

the late registration is subject to such fees and conditions prescribed by the
Minister.

_Subclause 15(c)_ seeks to amend section 21 of Act 299 seeks to introduce

a new subsection (2) into Act 299 to provide that the Registrar-General may
waive the fees prescribed for late registration, in whole or in part, subject to
the criteria and conditions to be determined by the Minister.

17. _Clause 16 seeks to amend section 22 of Act 299 to provide that, upon the_

death of any person who has been attended by a registered medical practitioner
during his last illness, the period to deliver a certificate to a qualified person
under section 19 of Act 299 or to the Registrar by the registered medical
practitioner is extended from twelve hours of the death to seven days of the
death. As the period for giving information concerning a death to the Registrar
under section 19 is extended from twelve hours to seven days in _clause 12,_
the period under section 22 of Act 299 is also similarly extended.


-----

18 _Bill_

18. _Clause 17_ seeks to amend section 23 of Act 299 to provide that, where

a _post-mortem examination of a body of any person is held, the period to_
forward a certificate to the Registrar by the registered medical practitioner is
extended from twenty-four hours after the conclusion of the examination to
seven days after the conclusion of the examination. As the period for giving
information concerning a death to the Registrar under section 19 is extended
from twelve hours to seven days in _clause 12, the period under section 23 of_
Act 299 is also similarly extended.

19. _Clause 18 seeks to amend section 24 of Act 299 to provide that, where an_

inquest or inquiry into the death of any person is held, the period to forward
a certificate to the Superintendent-Registrar by the Coroner or Magistrate is
extended from twenty-four hours after the conclusion of the inquest or inquiry
to seven days after the conclusion of the inquest or inquiry. As the period
for giving information concerning a death to the Registrar under section 19
is extended from twelve hours to seven days in _clause 12, the period under_
section 24 of Act 299 is also similarly extended.

20. _Clause 19_ seeks to introduce new sections 24a and 24b into Act 299.

The proposed section 24a seeks to provide that a person who has been

granted an order pertaining to a missing person’s presumed death under any
written law by a Court may forward the order to the Registrar for the purpose
of registering the particulars of the missing person’s presumed death. On receipt
of the order, the Registrar shall make an entry in a register containing the
name of the missing person and such other necessary information in relation
to the missing person’s presumed death. The proposed amendment seeks to
encourage the registration of a missing person’s presumed death upon receiving
an order from a Court and to assist the family members in dealing with
matters pertaining to the missing person with the issuance of a Certificate of
Presumed Death under the proposed section 24b.

21. _Clause 21 seeks to amend section 27 of Act 299._

_Subclause 21(b) seeks to insert a new subsection 27(3a) into Act 299 to_

provide that where the Registrar-General, the Superintendent-Registrar or the
Registrar is satisfied that from an inquiry held under section 37b an error of
fact or substance in any register exists, the error of fact or substance may
be corrected by the Registrar-General. The existing provision of section 27
of Act 299 only allows the correction of an error of fact or substance to be
made in the registers upon an application from a person requiring such error
to be corrected. The proposed amendment will allow the Registrar-General to
correct any error of fact or substance in the registers after the inquiry without
the need for an application to be made to that effect.

_Subclause 21(d)_ seeks to delete subsections 27(5) and (6) of Act 299. The

provision of subsection 27(5) of Act 299 which allows the Registrar-General
or the Superintendent-Registrar to correct any date or name of the place that
has been entered in Thai or Japanese to accord to the British calendar or the
place name used prior to the Japanese or Thai occupation is deleted because
it is no longer relevant and practised.

22. _Clause 23_ seeks to amend section 32 of Act 299 to provide for the

issuance of the Certificate of Presumed Death by the Registrar.

Certificate of Presumed Death shall be received without further or other proof
as evidence of such facts and particulars relating to a presumed death.

24. _Clauses 25_ and _26 seek to amend sections 34 and 35, respectively. The_

proposed amendments seek to increase the penalty imposed on offences relating

Act 299, respectively, considering that a higher penalty is imposed for like
offences under the National Registration Act 1959 [Act 78].

a new offence of knowingly possess or make use of a fake Certificate of

amendment also seeks to increase the punishment imposed for offences under
that section and provide that every offence under paragraphs 36(1)(a), (b),
_(c), (h),_ _(i),_ _(j),_ _(k),_ _(m) and_ _(n)_ are seizable offences.

26. _Clause 28 seeks to delete section 37a of Act 299 relating to the power of_

the Superintendent-Registrar or the officer authorized by the Registrar-General
to conduct a prosecution as the power to conduct a prosecution is the power
of the Public Prosecutor pursuant to Article 145 of the Federal Constitution.

27. _Clause 29 seeks to amend section_ 37b of Act 299 to empower the

Registrar-General, the Superintendent-Registrar or the Registrar to require any
document to be produced when necessary during an inquiry. The proposed
amendment also provides for an offence of failure or refusal of any person to
attend any inquiry, or to produce any document, or to answer any question,
when required to do so.

to compound offences.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
