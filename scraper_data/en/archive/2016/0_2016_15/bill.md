With the establishment of this Authority as a statutory body, the Authority will
have greater flexibility to attract and retain qualified technical personnel in
matters relating to civil aviation to ensure that the national and international
obligations of Malaysia in matters relating to civil aviation can be carried
out, and the universal safety and security standards and requirements in civil
aviation are implemented, complied with and well-maintained.
