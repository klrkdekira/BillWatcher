EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Offenders Compulsory Attendance Act 1954
(“Act 461”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the provision on the commencement of_
the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 2 of Act 461 to introduce a new definition_
of “Commissioner General” and to delete the definition of “Director General”.

4. _Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 461 to empower the Commissioner_
General to appoint an Officer in Charge as the Compulsory Attendance Centre
Officer to be in charge of each Compulsory Attendance Centre.

5. _Clause_ _5_ seeks to introduce a new section 4a into Act 461 to empower
the Commissioner General to issue standing order or give directions relating
to the Compulsory Attendance Order which shall be binding on the Compulsory
Attendance Centre Officer.

6. _Clause 6_ seeks to amend section 5 of Act 461.


-----

6 _Bill_

_Subclause 6(a)_ seeks to substitute subsection 5(1) of Act 461 whereby

with this proposed amendment, the court is empowered to make
a Compulsory Attendance Order against any offender who has been convicted
of any offence for which he is liable to be sentenced to imprisonment for
a period not exceeding three years.

_Subclause 6(b)_ seeks to introduce a new subsection 5(1a) into Act 461.

The proposed new subsection 5(1a) provides that the Court shall consider the
character of the offender, the nature and seriousness of the offence committed
by the offender before making any Compulsory Attendance Order.

7. _Clause 7_ seeks to introduce a new section 5a into Act 461 to empower
the Commissioner General to transfer any offender to another Compulsory
Attendance Centre upon an application made by the offender or if the
Commissioner General thinks fit to do so.

8. _Clause 8_ seeks to introduce a new section 6a into Act 461. With this
proposed amendment, any offender who is imprisoned following a conviction
or a preventive detention order while the offender is undertaking or yet to
undertake a compulsory work by virtue of a Compulsory Attendance Order
shall serve the sentence of imprisonment and the period of a compulsory
work required to be completed by virtue of a Compulsory Attendance Order
shall be deemed to have run concurrently with the period of imprisonment or
detention. Nevertheless, the offender is still required to undertake compulsory
work for any remaining period of compulsory work after deducting the period
of imprisonment or detention served by the offender from the period
as specified in the Compulsory Attendance Order if the period of the compulsory
work required to be undertaken is longer than the period of imprisonment or
detention.

9. _Clause 10_ deals with saving provision.

10. Other amendments not specifically dealt with in this Statement are minor
or consequential in nature.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure the amount
of which cannot at present be ascertained.
