_Wildlife Conservation Act (Amendment)_ 39

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010 (“Act 716”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act and the power of_
the Minister to appoint the commencement date of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to amend section 3 of Act 716 to insert new definitions_
and amend certain existing definitions used in Act 716.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to amend section 9 of Act 716.

_Subclause 3(a)(i)_ seeks to amend paragraph 9(1)(b) of Act 716 to provide

requirement for a licence to take or keep any part or derivative of any controlled
wildlife under Act 716.

_Subclause 3(a)(ii) seeks to amend paragraph 9(1)(d) of Act 716 to provide_

that the requirement for a licence to carry out the business of dealing under
that paragraph shall be applicable to the business of dealing which involves
any protected wildlife or any part or derivative of any protected wildlife.

_Subclause 3(a)(iii) seeks to delete paragraph 9(1)(e) of Act 716 as taxidermy_

business is covered under the business of dealing. Thus, it is sufficient for
a person who carries out a taxidermy business to apply for a licence to carry
out the business of dealing.

_Subclause 3(a)(iv) seeks to amend paragraph 9(1)(f) of Act 716 to provide the_

requirement for a licence to import, export or re-export any part or derivative
of any controlled wildlife.

_Subclause 4(b) seeks to amend subsection 10(2) of Act 716 to provide that_

where any activity under paragraph (1)(a), (b), (c) or (f) involves any protected
wildlife or totally protected wildlife, the person carrying out the activity
shall obtain a licence to keep the protected wildlife pursuant to section 9 or
a special permit to keep the totally protected wildlife pursuant to section 11,

_Subclause 5(b)(i) seeks to delete paragraph 11(1)(d) of Act 716 in consequence_

who carries on research or study on any totally protected wildlife will only
require a permit under paragraph 10(1)(d) of Act 716.

_Subclause 5(b)(ii) seeks to delete paragraph 11(1)(e) of Act 716 because_

the use of any totally protected wildlife for a zoo, commercial captive breeding,
circus or wildlife exhibition operation will only require a permit granted for
that purpose under section 10 of Act 716.

_Subclause 5(b)(iii) seeks to introduce a new paragraph 11(f) into Act 716_

to provide the requirement for a special permit to carry out the business of

permit or special permit while carrying out research, wildlife competition,
wildlife control services or performing any religious, customs or cultural
activities, as the case may be.

_Subclause 6(a)(ii) seeks to amend paragraph 17(1)(b) of Act 716 to provide_

that a captive breeder, holder of a special permit to carry out the business
of dealing or holder of a special permit to operate a zoo, wildlife exhibition,
wildlife rehabilitation facility, wildlife training facility or wildlife boarding
facility, shall display the permit or special permit at a conspicuous place of
his premises, as the case may be.

_Subclause 6(b) seeks to amend subsection 17(2) of Act 716 to increase_

the penalty provided for the offence under the subsection 17(1) of Act 716.

subsection 41(2), subsection 42(2), subsection 43(2), subsection 44(2),
subsection 45(3) and subsection 117(2) of Act 716, respectively, to increase
the penalties provided for the offences under those provisions.


-----

_Wildlife Conservation Act (Amendment)_ 41

9. _Clause 9 seeks to introduce a new section 25a_ into Act 716 to make it
an offence for any person who alters, forges, mutilates or defaces any licence,
permit or special permit granted under Act 716, or knowingly uses any
licence, permit or special permit which has been so altered, forged, mutilated
or defaced.

10. _Clause 10 seeks to amend section 28 of Act 716 to provide that_

the licensing officer shall not grant a permit to operate a zoo, commercial captive
breeding, circus, wildlife exhibition, wildlife rehabilitation facility, wildlife
training facility or wildlife boarding facility unless he is satisfied that the
prerequisites under paragraphs 28(a), (b) and (c) of Act 716 are complied with.

11. _Clause 11 seeks to amend section 29 of Act 716 to prohibit a person_

from possesing, keeping, setting, placing or using any snare except for
the purposes of carrying out wildlife research or study on any wildlife. Currently,
under Act 716, setting, placing or using any snare is prohibited only for the
purpose of hunting any wildlife. The proposed amendment will totally prohibit
setting, placing or using any snare except for the purposes of carrying out
wildlife research or study on any wildlife.
