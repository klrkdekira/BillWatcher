4 _Bill_

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend section 10 of Act 122.

_Subclause 2(a) seeks to substitute paragraph 10(1)(a) of Act 122 to empower_

the Controller, a supplies officer, police officer not below the rank of Inspector
or customs officer to arrest without warrant any person whom he reasonably
believed has committed or is attempting to commit an offence under Act 122.
Currently, any person whom the Controller or any supplies officer,
police officer not below the rank of Inspector or customs officer reasonably believes
has committed or is attempting to commit any offence under Act 122
may only be arrested without warrant if the person refuses to furnish his name and
address or furnishes an address out of Malaysia or a false name or address
or likely to abscond.

_Subclauses 2(b) and_ _2(c) seek to renumber subsection 10(1a) as_

subsection 10(1b) and to introduce new subsection 10(1a) into Act 122 as a
consequential amendment arising from the substitution of paragraph 10(1)(a)
of Act 122.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to introduce new sections 12a and 12b into Act 122.
The new section 12a seeks to provide that any controlled article or other article
seized under Act 122 which is of a perishable or inflammable nature or where
the custody of such controlled article or other article involves unreasonable
expense and inconvenience may be sold.

The new section 12b seeks to provide that no person shall, in any proceedings

before any court in respect of any controlled article, vehicle, vessel or thing
other than a controlled article seized in the exercise or the purported exercise
of any power conferred under Act 122, be entitled to the costs of such
proceedings or to any damages or other relief unless such seizure was made
without reasonable cause.

5. _Clause 4_ seeks to introduce a new section 25a into Act 122 to provide
that if articles which are suspected of being controlled articles are found
in two or more packages or receptacles of the same description, it shall be
presumed that all the packages or receptacles contain articles of the same
nature, quantity and quality and it shall be sufficient to open and examine one
per centum or not less than five samples of each description of the package
or receptacle in which such articles are contained. The court shall presume
that the articles contained in the unopened packages or receptacles are of
the same nature, quantity and quality as those found in the similar packages
or receptacles which have been opened.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
