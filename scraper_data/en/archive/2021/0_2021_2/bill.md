_Temporary Measures for Government Financing_ 3

_(Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) (Amendment)_

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill (“the proposed Act”) seeks to amend the Temporary Measures for
Government Financing (Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) Act 2020
(“Act 830”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title of the proposed Act._

3. _Clause 2_ seeks to amend subsection 3(1) of Act 830 to increase the
ceiling amount for the total amount of the sums that may be raised under
the Loan (Local) Act 1959 [Act 637] and the total amount of moneys that
may be received by the Government under the Government Funding Act 1983

[Act 275] from sixty per centum of the Gross Domestic Product of Malaysia
to sixty-five per centum of the Gross Domestic Product of Malaysia, when
calculated together. The increase of the ceiling is due to the funding required
to finance the addition to the total amount of the COVID-19 Fund from
sixty-five billion ringgit to one hundred and ten billion ringgit for the
programmes listed in the Schedule to Act 830.

4. _Clause 3 seeks to amend the Schedule to Act 830 to provide for additional_
amount for the programmes in items 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 19 under the economic
stimulus packages and economic recovery plans as well as to amend the total
amount allocated for all the programmes.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will involve the Government in extra financial expenditure of
forty-five billion ringgit.
