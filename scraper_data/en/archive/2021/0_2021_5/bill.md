[Subsection 15(5)]

MATTERS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY ESTATE DISTRIBUTION OFFICER

IN DISTRIBUTING ESTATE

In the exercise of any discretion of the Estate Distribution Officer to determine
whether to make a distribution order in accordance with any agreement between
the beneficiaries or in settling the terms of any distribution order providing for
the distribution of property, the Estate Distribution Officer shall have regard
to the following considerations:

_(a) in relation to immovable property—_

(i) dividing the land into several lots in several names may seriously

diminish the value of the estate as a whole;

(ii) the real value of small shares, especially when represented by

complicated fractions, is less than their proportionate values;

(iii) it is not conducive to good cultivation or to peace in a family

for persons who may have conflicting interests to be undivided
co-proprietors of land;


-----

18 _Bill_

(iv) it is greatly to the advantage of a minor or a person of unsound

mind that his co-proprietors should be those most nearly
related to him; and

(v) valuations are necessarily estimates and are only approximately

correct; it is unnecessary that the estimated value of a lot
should be precise amount of a beneficiary’s mathematical share;
it is sufficient if the estimated value of a lot substantially
corresponds to a beneficiary’s calculated share; and

_(b) in relation to movable property—_

(i) type of movable property whether can be divided or not; and

(ii) the rights to which any beneficiary or interested party is entitled

to may consist in terms of the physical share of the actual
movable property or its value.”.

**25. Saving**

(1) Any petition, application, investigation, hearing and
proceedings in relation to the distribution of a small estate pending
before the date of coming into operation of this Act shall be
dealt with in accordance with the principal Act as amended by
this Act.

(2) Any order, letter of administration, decision, determination,
direction, certification, appointment, reference, action and notice
in relation to the distribution of a small estate made, done or
issued by the Land Administrator under the principal Act before
the date of coming into operation of this Act, shall be deemed to
be made, done or issued by the Estate Distribution Officer and
continue to be in force.

(3) Any appeal to any order, decision or act made or done
under section 29 of the principal Act before the date of coming
into operation of this Act shall, after the date of coming into
operation of this Act, be continued as if section 29 of the
principal Act has not been amended by this Act.

_Small Estates (Distribution) (Amendment)_ 19

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Small Estates (Distribution) Act 1955 (“Act 98”).

purpose of a small estate, the estate of a deceased person now may involve
immovable property or movable property or both which the total value of the
property shall not exceed five million ringgit.

7. Clause 6 seeks to amend section 4 of Act 98 to empower the Estate
Distribution Officer of a State to deal with the distribution and administration
of estate of a deceased person which fall within Act 98.

_Clause 6 also_ empowers the President of Estate Distribution to transfer the

petition for distribution to be heard and determined by the Estate Distribution
Officer of other State for the general convenience of the parties. Currently the
powers to do such act are given to the Director General of Lands and Mines
and the Director of Lands and Mines.

_Clause 8 also empowers the Estate Distribution Officer to decide on the_

valuation to be applied in determining whether the estate is or is not small
estate in a case where there is more than one valuation.

9. _Clause 9_ seeks to amend section 8a of Act 98 to allow the petitioner
to obtain any document relating to any movable property comprised in the
estate of a deceased administered by the Amanah Raya Berhad prior to the
lodgement of the petition with the Estate Distribution Officer.

10. _Clause 10_ seeks to introduce new sections 8b and 8c into Act 98.

The proposed new section 8b deals with the power of the Estate Distribution

Officer to make order for summary distribution in specified cases upon
application by the petitioner or applicant.

The proposed new section 8c deals with the power of the Estate Distribution

Officer to grant letters of administration _pendente lite for the purpose of_
obtaining information from any party pending any distribution order.

11. _Clause 11_ seeks to amend section 9 of Act 98 to impose a duty on

the petitioner to serve a notice of the petition and of the date and place of
hearing to all persons named and addressed in the petition as beneficiaries or
claimants upon receiving such notice from the Estate Distribution Officer.

12. _Clause 12_ seeks to amend section 10 of Act 98 to provide for the

the Estate Distribution Officer.

unable to attend the hearing of a petition for distribution of a small estate to
submit a letter of consent.

The proposed new subsection 12(12) gives discretion to the Estate Distribution

Officer to proceed with the hearing despite the letter of consent referred to
in the new subsection 12(11) is not produced.
