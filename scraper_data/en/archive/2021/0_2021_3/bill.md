_Trade Descriptions (Amendment)_ 5

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

This Bill seeks to amend the Trade Descriptions Act 2011 (“Act 730”).

2. _Clause 1 contains the short title and the provision on the commencement_
of the proposed Act.

3. _Clause 2 seeks to substitute the long title of Act 730 to widen the scope_
of the Act to include the prohibition on the use of any statement, expression or
indication which is likely to discriminate or boycott any product or goods or
to discourage, forbid, hinder or influence any person from using or consuming
any product or goods in the course of trade or business. With the expansion
of the scope of Act 730, the statements, expressions or indications against
Malaysia’s major commodities especially palm oil such as the expression
“no palm oil” used in any advertisement including food labels, notices and
catalogues will be prohibited through the regulations to be made under Act 730.

4. _Clause 3_ seeks to introduce a new section 39a into Act 730 to empower
an Assistance Controller to arrest any person whom he reasonably believes has
committed or is attempting to commit any offence under section 5, 16, 17, 20 or 51
of Act 730.

5. _Clause 4 seeks to introduce a new section 52a into Act 730 to empower_
an Assistant Controller to demand, select, take or obtain samples of any goods
for the purpose of analysis, without payment, from any person manufacturing,
producing, selling or importing such goods or from its agent or servant.
The proposed new section 52a also seeks to make it an offence if any person
refuse to comply with any demand made by an Assistant Controller.

6. _Clause 5 seeks to substitute the shoulder note of section 54 of Act 730_
to reflect the provision of section 54.

7. _Clause 6_ seeks to amend section 56 of Act 730 to empower the Minister
to exempt any person or class of persons from the application of any provision
of Act 730. Currently, the Minister may only exempt any description of goods
which are intended for dispatch to a destination outside Malaysia or any
specific use or purpose.

8. _Clause 7 seeks to introduce a new section 56a into Act 730 to empower_
the Controller to make an order requiring any person to cease any contravention,
refrain from the contravention or refrain from any further contravention of
Act 730.

9. _Clause 8 seeks to amend paragraph 69(2)(b) of Act 730 as a consequential_
amendment of the long title of Act 730. The proposed amendment seeks to
expand the power of the Minister to make regulations to prohibit, restrict,
regulate or control the use of any statement in the course of trade of business.

10. _Clause 9 seeks to validate the charging and collection of fees for_
services rendered by the competent authority in respect of certification and
marking of halal for the period from 1 January 2012 to 22 October 2018.


-----

6 _Bill_

The charging and the collection of the fees are deemed valid although it was
made before the date of coming into operation of the Trade Descriptions
(Certification and Marking of Halal Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2018

[P.U. (A) 268/2018] which provide for the charging and collection of the fees
commencing from 23 October 2018.

_FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS_

This Bill will not involve the Government in any extra financial expenditure.
