powers of the Authority in order to ensure that every act and thing

provisions are in line with the duties and powers as set out under
the Ordinance. The proposed new subsection (5) of section 3 of
the Ordinance seeks to provide power for the establishment of funds
for the welfare and benefit of the persons and the dependants of
the persons, participating in land development and settlement
projects carried out by the Authority. Clause 2 (2) seeks to validate
and legalise every act or thing done by the Authority or the Minister
or by both, before the commencement of this proposed Act, that
would have been lawful if the provisions of subsections (2), (3) and
(5) of section 3 of the Ordinance, as amended by clause 2 ( I t ,
had been in force at the time when it was done.

3. Clause 3 (7) seeks to insert the new section 12s for the purpose
of empowering the Authority or its corporation to issue one or
more bank guarantees to any person for such purpose and to such
extent as determined by the Authority, with the approval of the
Minister, while clause 3 (2) seeks to validate and legalise any bank
guarantee issued by the Authority or its corporation before the
coming into force of this proposed Act.
