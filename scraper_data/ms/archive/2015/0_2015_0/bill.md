24 _Rang Undang-Undang_

offence relating to an organized criminal group, shall order
the same to be released to the person claiming the same
upon proof that he is lawfully entitled thereto, and shall, in
any other case, order the property to be forfeited.

(4) The provisions of this section shall be without prejudice

opportunity to be heard to the person holding the encumbrance
and hearing the reply of the Public Prosecutor to any
representations which may be made before that High Court
by the person holding the encumbrance.

(3) Where any property is vested in the Government under

person making a claim under subsection (1) when it is

group can be imputed to such person;

_(c)_ such person lacked knowledge and was not intentionally

Chapter, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any
written law.
